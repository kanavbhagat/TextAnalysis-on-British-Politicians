Scott Benton,2024 Resignation Statement,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/scott-benton-2024-resignation-statement/,"The statement made by Scott Benton, the Independent MP for South Blackpool, on 25 March 2024.It’s been the honour of a lifetime to represent our wonderful community in Parliament over the last four years.It’s with a heavy heart that I have written to the Chancellor this morning to tender my resignation as your MP. I’d like to thank the hundreds of residents who have sent supportive messages, cards and letters over the last few months and who have urged me to continue and fight the next election. The support that so many local people have given to me has made it all worthwhile.A Labour government would be catastrophic for our country. I’m mindful of giving a new candidate the time and space to campaign to prevent that from happening and it is for this reason that I have made this decision at this time.As your MP I have always sought to do what I believed to be in the best interests of Blackpool, and of our country. Over the last four years we’ve faced significant challenges with Covid and the cost of living. Despite the economic challenges these have created, our community has benefited through over £400 million in additional government funding and capital investment – the highest amount of any town in the entire country. Most of these projects (including planned regeneration in Revoe, Central Drive & Bond Street; the new multiversity; Blackpool Central Development; and many other Levelling Up projects) have yet to commence but we will reap the rewards of these in terms of regeneration, new jobs and opportunities in the years ahead. Our A&E, schools and Police have also benefited from significant extra funding too and I’m proud of the role that I’ve been able to play in delivering that. Blackpool is a special place and it’s future is bright.The most enjoyable part of the job has been being able to meet so many of you, either on the doorstep, or at the over 650 different charities, voluntary groups, sports clubs, churches and businesses I have visited. I will always cherish being able to contribute towards, and to see, the brilliant work which goes on, often by unsung heroes, in our community. I’ve held over 220 surgeries and events and my team and I have assisted over 19,500 local people with different issues and problems, having much success, but sadly some failures, along the way too. Being able to help those who have needed it most has been a privilege and my team and I will continue to work on all existing casework for those who have previously contacted me in this interim period.The global events of the past four years would have been extremely challenging for any government to deal with. The optimism and hope felt by many after we delivered Brexit in early 2020 was quickly overtaken by the pandemic and the challenges Covid has led to in terms of the economy and public services have proven incredibly difficult since. The government hasn’t got everything right and I’ve always been robust in speaking out for what I think our community and country needs in Parliament, having spoken on more than 350 occasions – one of the highest of all MPs since 2019. It’s easy for opposition politicians to criticise from the sidelines when they haven’t got any policies or a plan of their own. It’s a lot harder delivering for people when there are no easy solutions to many of the complex problems we face.In 2019, I pledged to be an active, hardworking and relatable MP who would listen to your concerns and views and act upon them: I’d like to think that I have more than succeeded in that aim. It’s in the best interests of our community that my successor succeeds and I wish them well.With best wishesScott",Other
Rishi Sunak,2024 Speech on Extremism,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-speech-on-extremism/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, outside Number 10 on 1 March 2024.In recent weeks and months, we have seen a shocking increase in extremist disruption and criminality.What started as protests on our streets, has descended into intimidation, threats, and planned acts of violence.Jewish children fearful to wear their school uniform lest it reveal their identity.Muslim women abused in the street for the actions of a terrorist group they have no connection with.Now our democracy itself is a target.Council meetings and local events have been stormed.MPs do not feel safe in their homes.Long standing Parliamentary conventions have been upended because of safety concerns.I need to speak to you all this evening because this situation has gone on long enough……and demands a response not just from government, but from all of us.Britain is a patriotic, liberal, democratic society with a proud past and a bright future.We are a reasonable country and a decent people.Our story is one of progress, of great achievements and enduring values.Immigrants who have come here have integrated and contributed.They have helped write the latest chapter in our island story.They have done this without being required to give up their identity.You can be a practising Hindu and a proud Briton as I am.Or a devout Muslim and a patriotic citizen as so many are.Or a committed Jewish person and the heart of your local community……and all underpinned by the tolerance of our established, Christian church.We are a country where we love our neighbours.And we are building Britain together.But I fear that our great achievement……in building the world’s most successful multi-ethnic, multi faith democracy……is being deliberately undermined.There are forces here at home trying to tear us apart.Since October 7th there have been those trying to take advantage of the very human angst that we all feel……about the terrible suffering that war brings to the innocent, to women and children……to advance a divisive, hateful ideological agenda.On too many occasions recently, our streets have been hijacked by small groups……who are hostile to our values and have no respect for our democratic traditions.Membership of our society is contingent on some simple things……that you abide by the rule of law, and that change can only come through the peaceful, democratic process.Threats of violence and intimidation are alien to our way of doing things: they must be resisted at all times.Nearly everyone in Britain supports these basic values but there are small and vocal hostile groups who do not.Islamist extremists and the far right feed off and embolden each other.They are equally desperate to pretend that their violence is somehow justified……when actually these groups are two sides of the same extremist coin.Neither group accept that change in our country can only come through the peaceful democratic process.Both loathe the pluralist, modern country we are.Both want to set Briton against Briton……to weaponise the evils of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred for their own ends.The faith of Islam, peacefully practised by millions of our fellow citizens……is emphatically not the same thing as the extremist political ideology of Islamism……which aims to separate Muslims from the rest of society.Islamist extremists and far rights groups are spreading a poison, that poison is extremism.It aims to drain us of our confidence in ourselves as a people, and in our shared future.They want us to doubt ourselves, to doubt each other, to doubt our country’s history and achievements.They want us to accept a moral equivalence between Britain and some of the most despicable regimes in the world.They want us to believe that our country, and the West more generally, is solely responsible for the world’s ills……and that we, along with our allies, are the problem.In short, they want to destroy our confidence and hope.We must not allow that to happen.When these groups claim that Britain is and has been on the wrong side of history, we should reject it, and reject it again.No country is perfect, but I am enormously proud of the good that our country has done.Our place in history is defined by the sacrifices our people have made,…in the service of our own freedom and that of others.And when these groups tell children that they cannot – and will not – succeed because of who they are…When they tell children that the system is rigged against them or that Britain is a racist country…This is not only a lie, but a cynical attempt to crush young dreams, and turn impressionistic minds against their own society.I stand here as our country’s first non-white Prime Minister, leading the most diverse government in our country’s history……to tell people of all races, all faiths and all backgrounds……it is not the colour of your skin, the God you believe in or where you were born, that will determine your success……but just your own hard work and endeavour.We must be prepared to stand up for our shared values in all circumstances, no matter how difficult.And I respect that the police have a tough job in policing the protests we have seen and that they are operationally independent.But we must draw a line.Yes, you can march and protest with passion…You can demand the protection of civilian life……but no, you cannot call for violent Jihad.There is no “context” in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes onto Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel/Gaza.And there can be no cause you can use to justify the support of a proscribed terrorist group, like Hamas.Yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government, or indeed any government: that is a fundamental democratic right.But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a State – or any kind of hatred or antisemitism.This week I have met with senior police officers and made clear it is the public’s expectation……that they will not merely manage these protests, but police them.And I say this to the police, we will back you when you take action.But if we are asking more of the police, we in government must also back up that call with action.To that end, this month the government will implement a new robust framework for how it deals with this issue.To ensure that we are dealing with the root causes of this problem……and that no extremist organisations or individuals are being lent legitimacy……by their actions and interactions with central government.You cannot be part of our civic life if your agenda is to tear it down.We will redouble our support for the Prevent programme to stop young minds being poisoned by extremism.We will demand that universities stop extremist activity on campus.We will also act to prevent people entering this country whose aim is to undermine its values.The Home Secretary has instructed that if those here on visas……choose to spew hate on protests or seek to intimidate people……we will remove their right to be here.And our Britain must not be a country in which we descend into polarised camps……with some communities living parallel lives.It is not enough to live side-by-side, we must live together……united by shared values and a shared commitment to this country.And I want to speak directly to those who choose to continue to protest:Don’t let the extremists hijack your marches.You have a chance in the coming weeks to show that you can protest decently, peacefully and with empathy for your fellow citizens.Let us prove these extremists wrong and show them that even when we disagree……we will never be disunited from our common values of decency and respect.I love this country.My family and I owe it so much.The time has now come for us all to stand together to combat the forces of division and beat this poison.We must face down the extremists who would tear us apart……there must be leadership, not pandering or appeasement.When they tell their lies, we will tell the truth.When they try and sap our confidence, we will redouble our efforts.And when they try and make us doubt each other……we will dig deeper for that extra ounce of compassion and empathy……that they want us to believe doesn’t exist, but that I know does.If we can do that, we can build on our great achievement in creating today’s Britain……a country of kind, decent, tolerant people.We can make this a country in which we all feel a renewed sense of pride.This is our home.So let us go forward together, confident in our values and confident in our future.",Conservative
Michael Gove,2024 Speech at the Convention of the North,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/michael-gove-2024-speech-at-the-convention-of-the-north/,"The speech made by Michael Gove, the Levelling Up Secretary, on 1 March 2024.Today is the day the North truly takes back control. Today, at this Convention, we inaugurate the biggest transfer of power and resources to the North in living memory. We all know that power is best exercised by those closest to the people they represent. We all know that the divisions in our society – economic, social, educational – are best bridged by empowering local leaders and local communities to determine the futures of the places where they live and the towns and cities that they love. And that is why today – at this Convention of the North – together – we are bringing about a power surge for the North.We have already agreed deals – agreed, not imposed or dictated – agreed deals with the mayors of the West Midlands and Greater Manchester to give them greater power over skills, transport and housing so the opportunity to get on, access to the best jobs and a safe, warm, decent home of your own are within reach of many more.And today we’re extending these same opportunities to West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and the Liverpool City Region. In technical terms that means Level 4 Devolution. In real terms it means more money and a bigger capacity to make a difference for Tracy Brabin, Oliver Coppard and Steve Rotheram.Yes, I know Tracy, Oliver and Steve are Labour politicians. And in a few months’ time we’ll be arguing passionately about different visions for the country as a whole. But – much more importantly to me, Tracy, Oliver and Steve are directly accountable local politicians with a mandate and a mission and a responsibility to deliver economic growth and improved opportunities for people in Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Castleford, Huddersfield, Dewsbury, Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Doncaster, Liverpool, Knowsley, Runcorn, Southport and the Wirral.And what’s important to me, and I know to them, is delivering for people in those cities and towns. Giving local politicians more power – with greater accountability – so local people can enjoy better jobs, higher wages, quicker journeys to work, more opportunities to learn, more attractive homes and an enhanced environment around them.The theology is devolution, the reality is improved lives for all.And I am also today clear we want to take forward devolution to many more areas across the country. With the North leading the way. I’ll be continuing to support the extended North East Mayoral Combined Authority grow from strength to strength. And I know the Chancellor will be saying more on how we support the north east in days to come. And I want to conclude a Level 4 deal with the great Ben Houchen – the one-man Northern Powerhouse who has done so much to bring investment and hope to the Tees Valley.And as well as the Level 3 deal we have with York and North Yorkshire we are also now implementing Level 3 deals with Hull and East Yorkshire, and also with Greater Lincolnshire. There are further Level 3 deals moving forward in Norfolk and Suffolk and, of course, a Level 3 deal has been secured for the East Midlands, and a Level 2 deal for Lancashire. We will also shortly be announcing more Level 2 devolution deals covering other parts of England.So we now have 19 devolution deals either established or in implementation covering over 33 million people. This is the most profound change to the way England has been governed in generations, it is a vote of confidence in local democracy and, in particular, a vote of confidence in Northern leadership. We  together are levelling up the North by giving power to its people.But that is very far from all we are doing together to demonstrate our commitment to the North of England and our shared determination to level up.We are working in partnership with civic leaders to irrigate the soil for the private sector investment which is vital for the enduring economic growth the North needs – which we all need.Here in Leeds, we are working with the council and the mayoral combined authority to lever in investment for new housing and new enterprises in Mabgate, the Innovation Arc, in Holbeck, West End Riverside, Eastside and Hunslet Riverside and on of course on the iconic Southbank. We’re working closely with the Royal Armouries here and working to secure and bring into public ownership a site for British Library North at Temple Works. I was also excited recently to meet with the Poet Laureate, Yorkshire’s own Simon Armitage, to hear his fantastic plans  for the UK’s only National Poetry Centre to be situated here in Leeds. I and my department will be doing everything we can to support that endeavour. And we’re also working to ensure that the existing strengths of the universities in Leeds, the life sciences sector, financial services sector, the tech sector and of course the cultural jewels of Opera North, Leeds Art Gallery and Channel Four can all be reinforced.And today I can go further.  I am delighted to be able to announce  that we have agreed with West Yorkshire the final plans for their new Investment Zone, focused in particular on health tech.  , It will direct £50m of additional investment to accelerate capital projects here in Leeds, and in Bradford and Huddersfield. And a further £25m of the funding will be used to give local people the skills they need to take advantage of over 7000 new high-quality jobs being created in the region all because of the Investment Zone.And to ensure that the Leeds Renaissance can benefit the greatest number of people in West Yorkshire – and beyond – we’re also investing two and a half billion pounds in a mass transit system which will link Leeds with Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield and Wakefield. The heart of West Yorkshire will be stronger and the arteries which connect Leeds to these proud towns will be enhanced – I don’t believe any  Government for decades has shown this level of commitment to Leeds, to West Yorkshire, to Yorkshire and indeed the North as a whole – and it is central to our shared moral mission to make opportunity more equal for everyone.Because Levelling Up – at its heart – is about public and private investment, partnership between central and local government, empowering local people to determine their own future and using all the resources of communities which have been overlooked and undervalued in the past – their educational, cultural, and entrepreneurial talents to shape economic growth and to deliver greater social justice.And that is why in our Levelling Up White Paper we set the direction for future central government spending in areas such as tech and culture – the two of the principal motors of growth in the decades ahead. And we are committed therefore to increasing spending on research and development – from both public and private sectors – faster outside the golden triangle of the South East and in the North .We are increasing Arts Council spending in the coming years outside of London and the South East and in the North And the Network North transport spending, which was announced earlier this week, sees millions more committed to improving transport links within and between the communities of the North and Midlands.Re-directing spending is crucial to Levelling Up – but so is making sure those resources are in the hands of the communities that they’re intended to benefit. That’s why Network North funding goes to councils, why Arts Council spending will support grassroots cultural organisations in the North, and enhanced R&D spend will be delivered through the North’s great universities.And we also know that across the North different communities have very specific needs which we can only effectively support by working in partnership with people on the ground to identify obstacles and opportunities.So, for example, in Liverpool, we know that the immense potential of the city and the wider region has been held back by an insufficiently coherent approach towards urban regeneration. There are iconic new investments and of course handsome historic buildings, but they sit alongside stalled sites and areas of untapped potential. That is why the vision set out in the Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel report is so important and we will back it with £31 million of new money  I can announce today for regeneration projects which trace an arc from the Knowledge Quarter to Bramley Moore docks on the waterfront.In Sheffield we know that city’s proud industrial heritage – augmented of course by the innovation we see at South Yorkshire’s Advanced Manufacturing Centre – also requires additional investment to reap benefits in the future. That’s why we’re investing £67 million to create over 1,330 new homes and 4,000 square metres of commercial space in the heart of the city. That’s on top of the £12 million we’re already invested through the Brownfield Housing Fund. And by working with Sheffield council and Oliver Coppard we hope to unlock a further half a billion pounds of private sector investment.We’re also investing more in Blackpool – a great town which has had to adjust to the changing nature of the visitor economy and has been held back by historically terribly poor housing – so we’re devoting another £90 million to transform some of the most deprived parts of the town centre to power Blackpool’s revivalI’m also committed personally to ramping up our support in Barrow – where the commitment that we have with British Aerospace to develop and build the next generation of nuclear submarines will generate thousands of new highly-skilled, high-paying jobs for decades to come – but with those jobs must come new housing, improved transport links for Barrow and even better educational institutions, and that’s a mission to which my Department is committed.In each of these communities – with diverse needs but all optimistic about the future – we’ve worked together to identify where the additional investment that we’re committing to the North can make the biggest difference.And that’s the philosophy driving our Levelling Up Partnerships – new initiatives from my department which lead to  deep relationships between the department and local leaders in Blackpool, Blyth, Grimsby, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and now, most recently in Blackburn. Together we identify the barriers to growth, and thendeliver bespoke investments which build on the community’s existing strengths. So in Blackburn our announcement today means £8 million for the arts and community venue King George’s Hall, £1.5 million to redevelop the Cotton Exchange and £1.5 million to revive Tony’s Empress Ballroom – one of the very few original Northern Soul dancefloors in the country. Sadly, I won’t be Out on The Floor for any forthcoming all nighters but as Levelling Up funding goes, do I love it? –  indeed I do.The principles governing our Levelling Up Partnerships – and indeed the 4.8 billion pounds worth of investment delivered though the Levelling Up Fund – are also behind our Long Term Plan for Towns. We know that for towns to succeed our great cities need to grow, but we also know that it’s the specific needs of towns, their individual strengths, their particular challenges, that need to be addressed if they are to benefit from the growth that our cities are powering. So that we know that in the towns around Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle and other great cities some, towns are doing better than others, some are better connected than others, some have higher productivity than others, but all have potential.In the 55 towns we’ve identified for investment, we’re making £20 million per town available – and we’re ensuring it’s a locally-constituted, grassroots-led town board which will draw up the bespoke plan for how that investment meets specific local needs. So in the Yorkshire towns with which we are currently working – Barnsley, Castleford, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Keighley, Rotherham and Scarborough – it will be local people who will be empowered and  local priorities which will be supported. Under the leadership of my friend Adam Hawksbee – who is committed to driving down power and opportunities much closer to these intimate communities – we will be building on  the success of this programme in weeks to come.I want to end on a personal note.And I want to end soon because the last time I spoke at this Convention I had so much to say about Levelling Up that Evan Davies had to cut me off. And I can see Clive eyeing his watch carefully.The reason why I am so committed to Levelling Up is because I came into politics to tackle inequality, to give a stronger voice to those who’d been cut out of the elite conversation, to uphold the principle that everyone is of equal worth and no one should be held back because of their background, their birthplace or their beliefs.Tackling entrenched inequalities, overcoming historic injustices, giving space and opportunities to those who’ve been overlooked and undervalued, it takes time – it requires money, yes, but it also requires us to reach across old political divides, to see the other person’s perspective, and to trust in the spirit of public service that animates so many of those who enter public life.In the election months ahead there’ll be arguments, of course, about priorities, policies and people. But at a time when the risks of division and polarisation are heightened I want us all here at the Convention of the North to recall and celebrate what he have in common – to feel optimistic and proud about every community in our country and resolved to ensure that we make the pursuit of greater opportunity for all a fight in which we are all in this room on the same side.",Conservative
Oliver Dowden,2024 Speech on AI for Public Good,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/oliver-dowden-2024-speech-on-ai-for-public-good/,"The speech made by Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister, at Imperial College on London on 29 February 2024.INTRODUCTIONLadies and gentlemen…The story of technological advancement is one of constant evolution…… punctuated by game-changing innovations.In my lifetime, the personal computer, the internet, the smart phone, have all made the tech world – and our interaction with it – unrecognisable.And they have all – in turn – transformed the way that citizens interact with government, and with public services.I believe another such game-changer has arrived…… in the form of transformative AI models – including Large Language Models – that enable computers and humans to interact in totally new ways.The last fourteen years has been a period of incremental tech improvements.The digital interfaces we use are largely recognisable.Yes – we have seized new opportunities…… such as rolling out gov.uk…… and making our services “digital by default”.But many of the systems that we use have not kept up with advances…… indeed some of them, I’m afraid to say, have not moved on at all.Modern AI has the potential to fundamentally change the way that public services operate within just a few short years.Indeed, if we are still working off the same systems – and in the same way – in another 14 years… or even frankly another two or three……then we will have failed to embrace the opportunity that now lies before us.OPPORTUNITYAnd so, just as the UK is leading the world in the field of AI safety…… the Prime Minister has asked me to ensure we are leading the world in the adoption of AI across our public sector.The opportunity here is hard to put a value on…… although I notice the IPPR have estimated that there is the potential to save £24 billion each year from roll-out of these new technologies.So for me it’s only by the rapid adoption of AI that we will drive the savings needed to put us on a sustainable path to a smaller state and better delivery of services.The pace of change is such that new opportunities are being uncovered literally on a daily basis, and a new world is opening out before us…AI is potentially – and I don’t say this lightly – a ‘silver bullet’…… it dangles before us the prospect of increased productivity, vast efficiency savings, and improved services.We are already beginning to see glimpses of what these tools have to offer…… and so I’d like to paint a brief picture of what the world might look like if we get this right:VISION OF SUCCESSIn healthcare – AI diagnostic tools could transform primary care……with appointments transcribed in real time by ambient AI, then instantly producing prescriptions and referrals……  scans read by AI with far greater accuracy …… and medicines tailored to individuals based on their genetics – again using AI.In education – … AI could help eliminate excessive paperwork ……freeing-up teacher time to focus on what they do best……AI assistants could help teachers to adapt lessons to the specific needs of each pupil…… and AI-augmented reality can take interactive learning to another level.In crime prevention – AI can direct police to where they are most needed…… spot patterns of criminality to discover culprits quicker than ever……and help keep the streets safer for everyone.And in all kinds of public sector casework – from immigration processing to benefit claims – AI can be used to summarise complex information…… enabling expert case-workers to spend more time actually making decisions.I could go on nearly forever to cover all areas of public administration…… because there are very few areas of the public sector that don’t have the potential to be enhanced by these tools.HOW DO WE GET THERE?The question, though, is how do we get there?I believe the measures we are bringing forward put in the structures, resources, and mindset…… to put the UK on the fastest path to successful adoption of public sector AI.Taking advantage of our unique strengths…… to revolutionise public services for everyone in the months and years ahead.Last year, I established a small team of data scientists, engineers and machine learning experts at the heart of Government – the Incubator for AI – or ‘i.AI’ – under the energetic leadership of Dr Laura Gilbert.The idea of these experts was to work with departments to target the biggest opportunities to both save money and deliver better public services.The quality of applicants for this program has been phenomenal.It is incredibly exciting to see such talented technical people choosing to enter public service…… bringing in new ideas to help change the way government delivers services.In a few short months this team of just 30 individuals have instigated 10 pilot programs, including…AI to flag fraud and error in pharmacies – that costs the taxpayer £1 billion every single year.A tool that will read and summarise responses to Government consultations, this says something about the scale of Government consultations, but this could save up to £80 million a year in central government alone…And AI algorithms to help move asylum claimants out of hotels more efficiently… helping to save further millions.And I can also announce our intention to roll out a new gov.uk chatbot that will provide an interactive interface for people to better navigate Government information and services.But this is clearly just the very start……I want to ensure that – where these pilots have proof of concept – we can scale them up as fast as possible…i.AI scale-up…And so, I can announce today that we will more than double the size of i.AI – to 70 people – recruiting the very best of British talent to drive this work across the public sector.This unprecedented influx of cutting-edge expertise into Government will enable us to design, build and – crucially – implement AI swiftly and at scale…Of course, there is still a huge role for the private sector – and I welcome the collaboration that we have with so many of the businesses in this room today.Nothing will match the strength and depth of the private sector AI innovation that is happening right now – and as all of you know so much of it here in the UK.But I believe that by embedding experts at the heart of Government…… and upskilling public servants to utilise these tools……we will set ourselves up to deliver the benefits to citizens as quickly – and as efficiently – as possible.HORIZONTALSThe other reason it is so important to have this team at the centre of Government is to ensure that – as AI rolls-out across the public sector – we adhere to the following principles:… sharing best practice……deploying individual models to multiple use-cases…… finding economies of scale..… and, crucially, ensuring interoperability.Although I don’t claim for the moment to have the expertise needed to actually build AI models…… I can see that – like so many great inventions – there is something beautifully simple about what they are actually doing.Indeed, when you boil it down, I think there are four ways AI can be applied to much of public sector activity…… spotting patterns of fraud and error;… helping the public to navigate services;… managing casework;… and automating internal processes.And so the i.AI team have been looking across these applications with those principles in mind…… And I have agreed with the Treasury that we will make all funding for Government AI projects contingent on departments collaborating with i.AI.Never again should we be investing money in IT systems without considering how to make them as efficient and interoperable as possible…… or without robustly challenging both the timelines and the costs to deliver better value.I want to ensure that where we develop a tool for one department – we are considering where else it could be deployed.MINISTERIAL FORUMAnd do to facilitate this discussion……to ensure departments are fully integrated into this cross-government effort…… we need a regular dialogue between all those involved across government.And so I am convening a meeting of the National Science and Technology Council on AI for public sector good …… alongside my Co-Chair, Michelle Donelan – our fantastic Secretary of State for Science and Technology.Every department has now designated a specific minister to be responsible for AI in their area…… and I have asked for them to meet on a regular basis.In the Cabinet Office, this work will be led by Minister Burghart…… and I want to thank him for the passion, purpose and drive that he has brought to the programme so far, as is often the case when you run a department you get to stand up and make the announcements, but actually Minister Burghart who has actually done the work to bring Government together to do this.WIDER PUBLIC SECTOR JOIN-UPOf course, central Government can only take this work so far…To truly maximise the benefits on offer we need to work with bodies and agencies right across the public sector.And so I am delighted to announce today that i.AI will sign a ‘Collaboration Charter’ with NHS England.This first-of-a-kind initiative will provide a framework for our experts in the incubator to support the NHS to identify and deploy AI solutions that improve services for patients.And I would urge other public sector bodies to consider doing exactly the same thing, I think it can bring enormous benefitsRESOURCINGThere is no shortage in the Government’s ambition to use AI for public good.We have put the expertise and the structures in place…… and we are making progress on our early pilot projects……but we also appreciate the investment that will be needed to make good on our ambition to see the UK leading the pack.And crucially, investment will be required both to improve services and cut costs…But also to pave the way for a leaner public sector.MITIGATING RISKThrough all of this, we are conscious of the need to guard against the risks that have rightly been flagged.And, while every effort will be made to eliminate bias, misinformation, and hallucinations…… ultimately, we are very clear about the need for human oversight…… and a clear distinction between AI suggestions and support on the one hand……and human decision making on the other.CONCLUSIONI believe we can take the worst things about public services……whether that’s the time-wasting, form-filling, pencil-pushing, computer-says-no, the mind-numbing-ness of it…… and the kinds of things that make us want to tear our hair out…We can take those things and we can turn them around with the help of AI.This is not about replacing real people with robots……it is about removing spirit-sapping, time-wasting admin and bureaucracy……freeing public servants to do the important work that they do best…… and saving taxpayers billions of pounds in the process.We’ve got the political will. We’ve got the world-class civil service. We have the big data. We have the tech companies.We are ready.So let’s not wait.Let’s lead the way……and join me in the AI revolution today.",Conservative
Stuart Andrew,2024 Speech at the Beacon Philanthropy and Impact Forum,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2024-speech-at-the-beacon-philanthropy-and-impact-forum/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Gambling Minister, at Guildhall Yard in London on 29 February 2024.Thank you for the introduction, Cath, and good morning everyone.It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you, on this extra day of the year.It seems apt to mention that today is also the final day of Payroll Giving MonthAnd I would encourage us all to consider this fantastic, tax-efficient way of donating to charity directly from your pay or pension.Giving is in the DNA of this countryAnd the UK is rightly acknowledged as a world leader in philanthropy.We know we are one of the most generous countries in the world – the record £12.7 billion given by the public in 2022 is a phenomenal amount.We know we have a proud tradition of philanthropy, but there is nonetheless plenty of room for growth.As the Minister for Civil Society, I am acutely aware of how central giving is to our communities and charities across the country.It’s something I also saw first-hand from my early career in the charitable sector.It’s not just across civil society that I have seen the transformative role that philanthropy plays.Philanthropy is integral to everything we do in DCMS.In sport, fundraising has been fundamental in delivering programmes which seek to deliver social outcomes through participation in sport and physical activity.In arts and heritage, philanthropy sustains our most beloved institutions – our museums, heritage sites, and performing arts venues.Our partnership with the Wolfson Foundation has played a major role here.As has our work with Arts Council England to support arts and cultural organisations to develop their fundraising skills and capacity to attract more private investment.The Cultural Gifts and Acceptance In Lieu scheme, meanwhile, has meant treasures such as Tolkien’s manuscripts in Oxford.Or the archives of children’s author Judith Kerr in Newcastle.Have permanent homes and are made accessible to the public.I know philanthropy is not just of critical interest to DCMS.Multiple departments are recognising the value of private capital for the public sector.The Office for Investment, a joint unit between No.10 and the Department for Business and Trade, has created a new concierge service for high value transformational philanthropic capital.Its objective is to increase giving from international donors, in the same manner that it does with inward investment.The lead official, Heather Davenport, is here today so please do speak with her to discuss this important topic.Spearheaded by the Secretary of State, DCMS is taking the lead role in coordinating efforts across Whitehall to foster a better operating environment for philanthropy in the UK.The Secretary of State spoke on this recently at an event I know many of you were able to attend, for the launch of the Onward report.She spoke about how we are committed to helping more people give and helping people give more.I want to reiterate the three core areas that she mentioned that we can accelerate across Government.Firstly, we want to better enable philanthropy and ensure the UK continues to be a good place to give.This includes helping people understand how they can give.We are working with the Financial Conduct Authority, wealth management firms and the Treasury to explore the possibility of providing greater philanthropy training for financial advisors.There is already some innovation in this space, with CFA Society UK recently launching their Certificate in Impact Investing.This provides investment professionals with the information they need to advise their clients on how their capital can have greater social and environmental impact.Alongside this, my officials are collaborating with HMRC to consider how the tax environment affects philanthropy, and are engaging with them on their potential work to digitalise Gift Aid.Complementing this work, we are continuing to support the growth and development of the social impact investing market, which delivers benefits to society alongside financial returns.We’re working with large scale investors, such as pension funds, to achieve the change we are looking for.We are also focused on unlocking the huge potential of Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs).These regional lenders provide affordable loans in the UK’s most disadvantaged places.Steps like these can make a huge difference for setting in place the right infrastructure across the country for both philanthropy and impact investing.Secondly, we want to encourage more philanthropy, particularly at a regional level.One example is West London Zone, a social outcomes partnership where philanthropic money is blended with national and local spend that only pays when measurable outcomes are achieved.Partly funded by DCMS, it has made a significant difference to children and young people’s life chances.Yet we know that philanthropy is still primarily concentrated in London and the south.So we want to explore how similar models could potentially be developed around the country that can maximise social impact.Can better reach marginalised communities, and can involve people of all backgrounds.The sharing of expertise is central to encouraging people to donate.Peer influence also makes a huge difference – one-third of wealthy donors report donating after being encouraged by friends or family.So we want to help bring together established philanthropists, and high net worth individuals, with the next wave of budding donorsWho are socially conscious and want to make an impact.People like Sir Lewis Hamilton, who has given £20 million to create his charity Mission 44And empower young people from underserved communities and diverse backgrounds.This leads me onto our third area of focus, of fully recognising how philanthropy transforms lives and communities.We’re seeing how alive and kicking philanthropy is in Stoke-on-Trent, for exampleWhere philanthropists of all levels of giving are making a difference.From Denise Coates, who has donated millions towards projects in the city, including £10 million to University Hospitals of North Midlands during the pandemicTo 23-year-old Matthew Bridger, who created his own foundation to provide grants for Stoke charities helping vulnerable people.Matthew was recognised earlier this year through the Prime Minister’s daily Points of Light awardWhich recognises the exceptional service people give to their communities.We want to celebrate more people who give through awards like these, especially through the Honours systemAnd I encourage you all to nominate worthy candidates.We also want to champion campaigns and events that highlight the impact of giving.So we want to help lead this conversation.But the Government cannot, and should not, drive this alone.To enable philanthropy, there are key evidence gaps we still need to understand.We need high net worth individuals and impact investors to play an active role.We need to be hearing from those making a difference with their giving, for us to amplify their voices.And so we also want to learn from you and listen.Today’s forum provides a perfect opportunity for this.As the name suggests, Beacon has been shining a light for many years now on the potential for philanthropists to unlock many of the challenges we face todaybringing together those with a shared social purpose, and the means to drive investment towards the places that need this most.I know there will be many rich conversations over the course of todayBecause there is a real buzz around philanthropy right nowAnd, as you have said, Cath, a real sense of hope, in what we can achieve togetherThere is an opportunity to capitalise on the kindness of the British public and help make their gifts go furtherTo help our charities and communities stay resilient and sustainableTo allow our world-leading sport, creative and cultural sectors to continue to flourishSo with that in mind, thank you again for inviting me to speak to you.I wish you a very successful day ahead and I look forward to continuing to work closely with the philanthropy sector to help it grow to its full potential.",Conservative
Stuart Andrew,2024 Speech at the Betting and Gaming Council Annual General Meeting,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2024-speech-at-the-betting-and-gaming-council-annual-general-meeting/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Gambling Minister, on 29 February 2024.Good morning everyone, and thank you for the invitation to speak today.Before I begin, I would like to say thank you to Brigid for all your work during your time as Chair of the BGC. We appreciate the constructive and considered input you and the BGC have provided to my department’s work, not just during my time as Minister but throughout your tenure.Last year my predecessor spoke of the important contributions BGC members make to our national economy. I would like to again recognise this contribution, not just in revenue terms, but also the social and entertainment benefits your businesses bring to millions of customers who enjoy gambling and suffer no harm at all. Throughout my time as minister, and as an MP, I have seen how this industry boosts both local and national economies through jobs and tourism.A lot has happened since your last AGM, I think that is a bit of an understatement. In April last year we published the White Paper, setting out 62 proposals that will ensure our gambling laws are fit for the modern age and I am absolutely aware of just how much hard work this has required from the BGC and its members, as well as my department and the Gambling Commission. I would therefore like to put on record my thanks to you all for your cooperation, your engagement and help in developing the proposals, as well as your hard work to begin their implementation over the last 10 months.I know that Michael is sick of the sight of me given that we meet almost every week but I have found that engagement really valuable.I would now like to provide you with an update on our programme of work and ensure you have clarity on the direction of travel.As you will all be aware, our White Paper strikes a balance between consumer freedom – preserving the rights of those who enjoy gambling and suffer no ill-effects – with the necessary action to tackle harmful gambling and the devastating consequences it can have for some individuals and communities.It includes a comprehensive range of measures that covers every aspect of the industry, reflecting the huge changes in the gambling landscape since 2005. Around half of the proposals in the White Paper have now been consulted on or have been completed.During Monday’s debate I made reference to the white paper consultations. I make no apologies for emphasising the importance of the consultations undertaken by the Government and the Gambling Commission. They have given us invaluable evidence to inform policy making. They ensure that the measures are robust, proportionate, and in line with the White Paper’s objectives. And they show that the Government is listening to your views and evidence.I would like to focus the rest of my time today on the announcements made last week by DCMS and the Gambling Commission on our work on online gambling measures.You will have seen that last Friday we confirmed the introduction of stake limits for online slot games. Bringing in limits for the first time is a key step in ensuring the regulatory framework is fit for the digital age. Our aim is not to prohibit play, but to embed best practice that many of you already do.We are confident that the limits of £5 for over 25s and £2 for 18 to 24 year olds represents a proportional response. It will see online slots aligned with casino limits and will ensure customers are further protected from unaffordable and life-changing losses.As set out in the consultation response, these limits will come into force in September this year and have the support of industry.We are confident that this is an important step forward in ensuring that the vast majority of people who gamble safely can continue to do so, but that enhanced protections are in place for those who may suffer harm.Turning to financial risk checks, the Gambling Commission confirmed last week that they will be proceeding with these proposals. I am sure you hear more on this from Andrew Rhodes later today, but their plans include both the light-touch financial vulnerability checks and the enhanced financial risk assessments.The financial vulnerability checks are intended to be introduced in two stages over the course of this summer. Responding to feedback received through the consultation, the Commission has reassured everyone that they will never require gambling businesses to consider an individual’s personal details, such as their postcode or job title, as part of the checks.To ease the introduction of these checks, they will initially come into force at a higher threshold for a short period of time, before reverting to a lower threshold later in the year. We expect this lower threshold to be closely aligned with that proposed in the white paper.I know that some of your members have concerns with the proposed system of checks. I would like to reiterate that both the Government and the Gambling Commission are listening, because we genuinely we want to get this right.We are clear that financial risk checks should not overregulate the gambling sector, should not unduly disrupt the millions of people who gamble without suffering harm, and should not cause unnecessary damage to the industry.The proposed system will be a significant improvement to the current system of inconsistent so-called ‘affordability’ checks, which are often onerous for customers to complete. It will provide clear and proportionate rules which all operators are held to, and allow for financial data to be shared seamlessly with operators, instead of burdening customers with information requests.I have been clear that these checks should be genuinely frictionless – one of my first discussions with officials on taking on the gambling brief was around how we would deliver this – and the White Paper was clear that they will not be implemented until we can guarantee that they are.To ensure these checks are implemented in an effective but proportionate manner the Gambling Commission has announced it will conduct a pilot over the coming months. I am pleased that the pilot will involve collaboration between the Commission, credit reference agencies and a selection of gambling businesses to ensure that the process of an assessment is effective. The sector’s involvement gives me confidence that we will be able to find a solution that everyone can support.We are therefore grateful for the input of BGC members into this pilot to ensure it is a meaningful test of the policy. The Commission will consider all issues that arise during the pilot stage – and are clear that this will help refine the final requirements and the models for data-sharing. I, and the Government, are supportive of the evidence-led and consumer-centred approach being proposed during this pilot.But until these checks are fully in place, it is essential that the industry is more transparent with its customers.An industry-led code is an important stepping stone while frictionless checks are piloted. It will mitigate the impact of customers having to provide documentation, while we develop this new, frictionless system of checks.I know that discussions are ongoing between the Commission and industry, and I really would urge all parties to come to an agreement on this code as soon as possible for the benefit of customers.I would now like to turn briefly to horse racing and the concerns about the impact of financial risk checks on the sport. I want to reassure you again that we have heard these concerns and take them very seriously.I have met with the British Horseracing Authority and the Betting and Gaming Council several times as we conduct our review of the Horserace Betting Levy, which is due by April this year.As there is currently no legislative opportunity to amend the levy, I have encouraged the betting and racing industries to work together on a voluntary deal. I am very grateful for the constructive manner in which those negotiations have taken place. We said in the White Paper that we will ensure that racing is appropriately funded going forward, and I am confident that agreement can be reached which is mutually beneficial and is in the best interests of the sport.I am grateful for the work which operators have undertaken with the Gambling Commission to explore the practical aspects of implementing these checks. We want to protect those at risk of harm – something that I make no apologies for – but with minimal disruption to the majority, who I recognise bet on horse racing with no ill effect.We know that British racing is a substantial asset to the country. We remain committed to supporting the industry to prosper, and I am confident that the way in which these checks will be implemented will not prevent that from happening.I know you will be keen to understand what is coming next in the pipeline.We will publish our consultation responses on land-based gambling measures and the statutory levy in the coming months, and will lay secondary legislation to bring measures into force across all relevant areas as soon as parliamentary time allows. Nonetheless, I am absolutely determined to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to bring key measures into force by the summer of this year.Thank you again for inviting me to speak today, and giving me this opportunity to update you on our programme of reform. As we look to conclude work on our key proposals I hope I have demonstrated to you that we will continue to listen, we will test, and we will adapt our approach as this fast-moving industry develops and I thank you for that continued engagement.",Conservative
David Cameron,2024 Speech at the Blue Belt Symposium,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2024-speech-at-the-blue-belt-symposium/,"The speech made by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, on 29 February 2024.It is a huge pleasure to be with you on this day where we are celebrating yet another expansion of the Blue Belt.It is something I started as Prime Minister in 2014. I remember some very talented and committed environmental enthusiasts like Zac Goldsmith, Oliver Letwin, Richard Benyon coming and seeing me and telling me about this idea and getting really excited by the idea of what it could all mean. You have these sort of meetings and think, ‘will anything come out of it?’ And now when I look around and see what you have all achieved, it really is a great cause for celebration and so it is a real privilege to be with you and celebrate it tonight.There are 5 obvious things to say about why I’m so enthusiastic about it.Firstly, incomparably, it is the right thing to do. We all know the stress that our oceans are under. We all know problems of plastic, the problems of overfishing, the problems of deep-sea mining, the problems of over-extraction, we know all those problems.This isn’t the answer to all of them, but it is part of the answer. And it is such a brilliant answer. And, we know the oceans are responsible for 50% of the oxygen in our atmosphere and so it is undoubtably the right thing to do.My father used to say to me, “if you get involved in politics, always remember, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing”. Well, this is incomparably the right thing. And it is so good that we are all doing it together.The second is, it is beautifully simple.I’m a bit of country boy, I represented a rural seat in Oxfordshire for many years, and the idea of fallowing, leaving a field fallowed, to let the land get back some of the minerals, some of the goodness, some of things you need in order to have productive soil. Something we’ve done for ages, forever.And applying that principle to our oceans is such a simple concept. As I say, it won’t solve all the problems but giving a large part of our oceans a rest, a break, is so easy to get a hold of as a concept. It something we are doing, which the rest of the world is applauding. The United Nations have set a target that 30% of our oceans should have this break by 2030 and the Overseas Territories of Britain are certainly doing our bit. In fact, more than our bit.The third thing I love about it is that it is big and it is bold. We are not the biggest country in the world, we are the 6th largest economy in the world. Some of the Territories represented here – from Pitcairn to British Virgin Islands to Tristan da Cunha – are not the largest countries in the world either but what we have done is something amazing.This is the biggest Blue Belt in the world. On the planet. The biggest one that has ever been created. Between us, we’ve done something together that is absolutely world-beating and world-leading. And bigger than anybody.The fourth thing I wanted to say is this is such a good example of partnership.I know that sometimes the Overseas Territories can feel as though they are not as loved as they should be, they can sometimes feel that they don’t get all the attention they should get. I really want us to change that and I think we are changing. I think you’ve got an excellent minister in David Rutley, he is not here tonight he’s probably on one of the islands. He works so hard and has done so much to bring the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies together.I’m feeling pumped up about the Overseas Territories having just come back from a trip to the Falklands Islands, a wonderful place. There aren’t many places where a politician like me can go for a walk about and you have such a wonderful time and everybody is lovely to you, I thought ‘this is great, I can even come and live here’.Fifth and final thing, is this issue of legacy.Legacy for all of us. I’ve got 3 relatively young children. And they care about this issue on our planet, on our climate and what we are going to leave to our children, more than any other issue. And they are always quite rightly challenging me and others about what we are doing.There is no doubt that when the history books are written, about what we did to cut carbon in our atmosphere, what we did to make the green transition, what we did to move away from coal, there will be some good things we’ll be able to say and some things we’ll be less mad about.But there is no doubt that on this agenda, we’ll be able to say that Britain created, with theOTs, the biggest, the best, the boldest in terms of marine conservation and in terms of Blue Belt, in terms of giving our oceans, our seas, a break.I think that is something we can all be proud of. It is something to celebrate, it is something to think about. There are so many issues we discuss every day that we won’t even remember in ten, twenty years’ time. ‘Why did that minister resign, why was that scandal happening in parliament?’ Can’t remember any of them. But this we will remember, and we should remember it with pride.I want to thank everyone that has made this possible. All the organisations that have helped. But above all, the Overseas Territories that have helped bring this together, that have helped create this Blue Belt, and create this massive bonus for the environment, bonus for oceans and legacy for our children and grandchildren.Thank you very much indeed.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2024 Speech at the CST Annual Dinner,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-speech-at-the-cst-annual-dinner/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, in London on 28 February 2024.Lloyd, thank you for that kind introduction.And in fact can I start by asking everyone to join me in thanking Gerald, Mark, and everyone at CST for all you do to keep our Jewish community safe.It is shocking, and wrong, the prejudice, the racism we have seen in recent months.That Hamas attack of October 7th was the most abhorrent act of terrorism against Israel that any of us have ever known.And it’s been followed by record levels of antisemitism in this country that are utterly, utterly sickening.Don’t let anyone try and tell you this is just a reaction to the response of the Israeli government as unacceptable as that would be.The highest weekly total of antisemitic incidents came before Israel responded…It is hatred pure and simple.An assault on the Jewish people – here in this country, in this century and I tell you tonight: we will fight this antisemitism with everything we’ve got.When Jewish children are hiding their school uniforms Jewish students are facing harassment on campuses the birth certificates of Jewish children are being defaced and Jewish families feel unable to enter the centre of our capital city at the weekend the whole fabric of our nation is under threat.When I went to Kinloss Synagogue in the immediate aftermath of October 7th I said I would stand with you today, tomorrow, and always.And I truly meant it.Of course, we cannot solve this problem overnight.But as Prime Minister I will lead this government in a long-term effort to strengthen your security defend our liberal democratic values and change our culture so we tackle the root causes of this hatred.Let me say a word about each.One of the things I most remember about that vigil in Finchley was walking out of the synagogue at this heightened moment of grief and fear in the community and seeing CST volunteers working with the police to keep us safe.Just as they are doing here today. Just as they do every day.They are some of the bravest volunteers in this country and on behalf not just of the Jewish community – but the whole nation I want to say a huge and heartfelt thank you.In October we announced an additional £3 million for CST taking our total support to £18 million for this financial year.And I can confirm we’ll commit a further £18 million next financial year.But that’s not enough.For years you’ve been asked to bid for funding one year at a time as if there might not be the same threat to deal with next year.Sadly, we know CST is going to be needed for many years to come.So tonight, I am changing the way CST is funded to help you plan for the long-term.I’m not just committing £18 million for next year.I’m committing a minimum of £18 million every year for the next four years.More than £70 million for the protection of our Jewish community.And I tell you – that is the single biggest financial commitment that any government has ever made.Of course, it’s not just the Jewish community that has been targeted.It’s also those who represent you.Members of Parliament – like Mike Freer, here tonight.Whatever political loyalties people might have I’m sure I speak for everyone when I say how sorry we are, Mike, that you had to stand down and how grateful we are for all you’ve done to support CST.As Prime Minister, I’m not prepared to stand by, and watch MPs forced out of public service because of fears for their safety.Nor I am prepared to allow this pattern of increasingly violent and intimidatory behaviour seemingly intended to shout down elected representatives and hijack the democratic process through force itself.It is as un-British as it is undemocratic.And it cannot stand.So today I met senior police leaders in Downing Street to discuss how they will use the powers they have to defend our democracy and our values from those that seek to hijack them.This included agreeing today a new Defending Democracy Protocol with additional patrols on MPs’ homes and constituency offices and new guidance to make clear to officers how they should protect surgeries, fundraisers, and protests all underpinned by £30 million of new funding for protective security – with every MP, councillor and candidate having a named police contact.We will never give in to the threats of violent extremists.We will not be cowed into changing the way our parliamentary democracy operates.We will do whatever it takes to defend our democratic processes just as we will do whatever it takes to keep you safe.But it’s not enough merely to strengthen our physical security we must also be far bolder and more assertive in defending our British values.We’ve got to end this passive tolerance of words and actions that go against what we stand for.Yes, you can march and protest with passion; you can demand the protection of civilian life but no, you cannot call for Jihad there is no “context” in which its acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes onto Big Ben and there’s no cause you can use to justify the support of proscribed terrorist groups, like Hamas.And yes, you can freely criticise the actions of this government, the Israeli government or indeed any government.But no, you cannot use that as an excuse to call for the eradication of a State – or any kind of hatred or antisemitism.These statements are fundamental to the liberal democratic values that define Britain.They are the very essence of our identity of who we are as a country.To belong here is to believe these things; to stand up for these things.And it’s time we were much, much clearer about this.Now, we’ve already taken some important steps.Within days of October 7th CST joined Ministers and police chiefs around the cabinet table in Downing Street to discuss the policing of protests.And since then we’ve taken decisive measures to stop a small and aggressive minority of protestors carrying out antisemitic and intimidating actions.Under our proposed laws:The possession of flares and other pyrotechnics at protests – illegal.Purposefully concealing your identity – illegal.Climbing on our war memorials – illegal.Treating protest as an excuse to engage in disruptive acts like criminal damage, blocking highways or ignoring police instructions – we’re ending that too.And when Hizb ut-Tahrir celebrated that October 7th attack this government drew a line in sand and proscribed it.But we need to go further – especially in our universities.What is happening right now on campuses is simply not acceptable.Jewish students are being targeted, threatened, and assaulted simply for being Jewish.The Chaplain at the University of Leeds having to take his family into hiding after death threats because he’s an IDF reservist.Iranian generals – let me say that again – Iranian generals – giving antisemitic speeches as people abuse the right to freedom of speech as a cover for hate speech.This cannot go on.Where people break the law on our campuses they will be met with the full consequences.And where they create a culture of intimidation we will hold the university leadership to account.University leaders must take personal responsibility for protecting Jewish students in their institutions.I want you to know that we are calling in the Vice Chancellors of the country’s leading universities to meet in Downing Street to discuss exactly how they will do that.And this goes to my third point.Because we cannot just litigate our way to defeating antisemitism and extremism.We’ve also got to change the culture in our country.Where is the willingness to speak out and challenge hateful narratives?Where is the ability to disagree with each other while retaining respect for one another?None of this will change overnight.It will take painstaking work over months and years.But this government will lead by example and make an unprecedented effort to tackle the root causes of antisemitism across our society in a more joined up way.We will call out hateful narratives.We’ll invest in interfaith work to build greater community cohesion and understanding between others tackling anti-Muslim hatred as well as antisemitism, with the help of brilliant organisations like Tell Mama.But we won’t fund those who risk undermining that effort.So when the Inter Faith Network charity appointed a trustee from the Muslim Council of Britain whose previous leaders have taken positions that contradict our fundamental values we ended their funding.We will continue to use all our diplomatic efforts to free the hostages through an immediate humanitarian pause.Earlier this month I met the families of Emily Damari, Nadav Popplewell, Eli Sharabi and Oded Lifschitz.Their harrowing ordeal is beyond heartbreaking.We have to bring them home.And we must work towards the long-term future we all want to see, of a safe and secure Israel with Palestinians living in dignity on a pathway to a viable Palestinian State.But we don’t achieve anything by calling for a permanent ceasefire without those hostages being returned and Hamas being removed from Gaza.A permanent ceasefire without those things isn’t a ceasefire at all.It’s a victory for Hamas.And this government won’t stand for it.The biggest step we can take in changing our culture is education.As so many of our extraordinary Holocaust survivors have said so much more eloquently than I ever could we’ve got to teach people not to hate.That’s why we’re investing another £7 million to tackle antisemitism in our schools and universities.And it’s why the Learning Centre is such an important part of the Holocaust Memorial.Not only to educate those who visit the Memorial in London but as the cross-party Holocaust Commission first recommended to support a national educational mission to fight antisemitism and hatred in all its forms.Britain is the most successful multi-ethnic democracy on earth.But we won’t stay that way if we end up with some communities living parallel lives.It is not enough to live side-by-side, we must live together united by shared values and a shared commitment to this country.Let me finish on a personal note and I hope a positive one.Now my own personal story is different from yours.Despite the assertion in the Jewish Chronicle that and I quote – “Rishi Sunak is a nice Jewish boy” I’ve still not found any Jewish ancestry in my family tree.But I do know something of what it is like to be seen as different from others and even to experience hatred directed towards your community because of who you are.I know something of what it is like to be part of a community that is both proud of its own heritage and proud of its Britishness too.I know something of what it is like to be part of a community that integrates with others from all backgrounds in society and that makes such an extraordinary contribution to our proud multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy.That’s why supporting Britain’s Jewish community feels so personal to me.You represent who we are and what we stand for in the world.And that’s not just something to be defended.It’s something to be cherished and celebrated.And that is what I will always do.Thank you.",Conservative
James Cartlidge,2024 Speech at the International Military Helicopter Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/james-cartlidge-2024-speech-at-the-international-military-helicopter-conference/,"The speech made by James Cartlidge, the Minister for Defence Procurement, on 27 February 2024.On the subject of medium helicopters as it were, as you know, they’ve been involved in almost every operation of significance for decades, ferrying troops and supplies under fire in the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan and evacuating casualties, helping NATO restore peace to the Balkans, saving countless lives with humanitarian aid from Mozambique to the Caribbean, and moving our diplomats around Kabuk when travel by road was too dangerous. And they have been in a constant state of readiness in a counter-terrorism role.Now over the decades, UK Governments have commissioned, procured and upgraded numerous platforms including many iconic names that you’re all very familiar with, from the Scout in the 1950s, the Sea King in the 1960s, the Lynx, Puma and Gazelle in the 1970s to the more recent Wildcat and Merlin, and I’ve had the privilege of flying in a number of them, recently aboard one of our Wildcats flying to Yeovilton to see how artificial intelligence has improved their support and crucially, their availability. Very recently I visited RAF Valley to fly in the Jupiter training helicopter and actually learned while I was there this really pleasing fact that, for the first time in a long time, we now have more pupils training than in hold, which is, as you know, one of the accumulated issues from the pandemic which led to significant holes. So that’s really positive,But a particularly memorable flight for me was last summer between Schipol and Den Helder for what’s called the Navy Day in the Netherlands. Is anyone here from the Netherlands? I don’t know if you were there, but anyway, I had an interesting ride with the Dutch Marines in the NH-90. So we’re just flying about 2,000 feet. I was in that seat by the door. You have a little sort of X-strap. And the marine said, ‘Minister you want to put your plastic glasses back on. I’m gonna give you a close up view of the offshore wind farms’, and he opened the door. All I can say is if you’ve ever experienced that, it’s very windy a few thousand feet up. The thought that went through my mind was ‘I think the Prime Minister is going to have to have another by-election very quickly’. It was very windy.Turning to procurement and the main subject, so when my predecessor took the decision in 2021, to invest in the next generation of medium helicopter power – the efficiencies that would come from a versatile single platform were clear for all to see in terms of procurement, training, contract support, and maintenance. Fast forward to today and we’re at the next stage of that process. I’m pleased to announce that I’m about to issue the paperwork that will initiate an invitation to negotiate with all three candidate suppliers of our next generation New Medium Helicopter, Airbus Helicopters UK, Leonardo Helicopters UK, and Lockheed Martin UK.All three companies have shown their platforms can meet the different needs of our Armed Forces, and you’ll note, listed alphabetically without any prejudice, all good competitor companies. So later, you can hear more about the process and other procurement programmes from Commodore Woodard, our SRO, senior responsible owner for delivering the New Medium Helicopter programme. And I know Commodore Woodard shares my determination to ensure that this programme is a beacon of smart procurement because as you will discover quite soon hopefully we are right in the middle of a very significant form of defence acquisition in the UK.So this will be built around affordability and more timely and thorough challenge. Future proofed by factoring adaptability and spiral development at the concept stage. And above all, a procurement programme that implements the lessons from Ukraine which is quite simply that we must close vulnerabilities in our supply chains by strengthening UK defence skills and production. We want to expand on each of these elements. When we first announced the programme, we quickly put in train a pre-qualification process to select credible candidates ahead of the outline business case stage. This has delivered significant efficiencies for both government and industry.We’ve also adapted our approach as a result of timely and robust internal decisions, ditching our original plan to include helicopters for our bases in Cyprus and Brunei within this programme, and instead announcing our intention to acquire six Airbus H155 helicopters to avoid unnecessary over-speccing, and overspending on platforms that were never intended operating in a war zone. In short, making a significant saving without the inefficiencies of diversifying our existing helicopter fleet.Another important feature of our Medium Helicopter programme will be our ability to spirally develop these platforms – we will order largely off the shelf models with open system architecture that we can spiral with enhanced capabilities to meet different operational needs or to accommodate new innovations, meaning our new medium helicopter will be adaptable and future proof.The final element that reflects our smarter approach to procurement is our UK industrial contribution consideration. This is a points based decision making process that we have designed to favour suppliers who do more to strengthen the UK defence industrial base – which should account for 15% of our overall procurement decision, we will reward those who invest in the UK’s rotary wing design industry, a critical national capability and sector and it will advantage those platforms with export potential by using an export criteria that is worth 20% of the UK industrial contribution weighting. This matters because exports sustain UK manufacturing and high value jobs in the UK and they strengthen and sustain our indigenous skills base, which is essential to building resilience into our defence sector and national security and critical if we are to remain a global player in the sector for decades to come.Our New Medium Helicopter programme is one of the very first to have this pro-export component built into our selection criteria. As Minister for Defence Procurement, I will ensure exportability becomes a factor in all relevant new procurement programmes. We’ll be saying more on that soon. But that formula of the design requirement plus export requirements equals, if you like, a combination of the quality of work we want to see in the UK, plus its sustainability for the long term.And I will also work to ensure that an expectation of spiral development also becomes a default in all relevant programmes. Our procurement must have the dynamism and flexibility to respond to this era of seismic technological change. That means being open minded to all that tech can offer. No platform is sacred.So last week, I launched our new uncrewed systems strategy at the headquarters of a successful UK drone company, Malloy Aeronautics, they gave a demonstration of their T-150 drone, which has proven extremely effective delivering supplies to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including supplying Ukrainian Marines on the other side of the Dnipro River. Underlining that they really are in action on the front line. And uncrewed systems like the Malloy drone are transforming warfare and they will continue to shape it in ways we are barely able to conceive. To make sure we keep ahead of our adversaries, we are building a renewed relationship between government and industry, turning intelligence from the battlefield into solutions in the factory and a competitive edge for our forces in weeks, days, even minutes.Now, obviously in lots of countries here some people may be sceptical about the speed of procurement as all countries face the challenge in this area. But my most insightful visit I’d say, as the Minister for Defence Procurement I’ve visited many bases and companies, was to a UK SME called Callen-Lenz, based in the southwest, who were spiralling a drone for use in Ukraine. And while I was there we had feedback from the frontline and the next day they put those changes in place. As Minister of Defence Procurement, you do not normally see that sort of turnaround in learning from procurement. That is the era we are now in – rapid spiral development. And I believe that taking that into account the recent decisions of the US to cancel their FARA programme was in large partly a reflection of this new reality and aligns with our own thinking.Procurement must be smart, agile, and responsive, ready to pivot and adapt to the changing nature of threats and to accommodate war-winning innovations. That’s why our next generation medium lift helicopter will deliver a Swiss Army Knife platform, future proofed and procured in a way to give the UK Armed Forces and our defence sector maximum clout and flexibility, a 21st century platform delivering on our modernisation agenda that can meet multiple needs now, and be easily adapted in the future, procured through a process that incentivises investment in the UK, which will deliver high value jobs, high value exports and help make us more secure. I look forward to your questions.",Conservative
Robert Halfon,2024 Speech to the Annual Apprenticeship Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-halfon-2024-speech-to-the-annual-apprenticeship-conference/,"The speech made by Robert Halfon, the Education Minister, in Birmingham on 27 February 2024.Hello – I’m sorry I can’t be with you today as planned.I hope you’ve had a brilliant couple of days discussing every aspect of apprenticeships delivery.I want to say thank you to Shane [Mann] and FE Week for organising this conference.I always say that FE Week makes the life of a Skills Minister difficult – but it makes complacency impossible!Whenever I want to find out what’s going on in the DfE, I read FE Week.My whole political life has been about championing apprenticeships and skills.I’ve done this because I’ve seen the good they can do in my own constituency.They are the greatest tool we have for advancing social justice.A range of complementary training options, from Level 2 to degree level, will allow people of all backgrounds to climb the Ladder of Opportunity – gaining the skills they need to improve their income and their future.Recently I took a journey from West to East, from St Austell to Ipswich.The Proclaimers may have walked 500 miles, but I covered 843 over the course of National Apprenticeship Week.I met apprentices, employers and training providers who were full of enthusiasm for the programme, keen to demonstrate their skills and teaching.They really want skills education and industry to succeed in this country.More importantly, they are putting in the hard yards to make it happen.My 3 Goals for ApprenticeshipsThe government’s reforms and investment have seen a transformation of the skills landscape.This has already brought about incredible dividends.There are now nearly 690 apprenticeship standards – each one designed by employers with IfATE to teach the skills that employees really need.While a lot has been achieved – with the help of many here today – there is still much to do.My 3 goals I’d like to discuss today are:Building an Apprenticeships NationPrioritising quality over quantity, andMaking sure apprenticeships serve social justice, by bringing opportunities to those who need them most.Building an Apprenticeships NationBuilding an Apprenticeships Nation means integrating apprenticeships into the way that everyone sees work, study and recruitment. They are not a minority pursuit for people who didn’t choose university, or just a pathway dedicated to ancient, guilded trades (though they’re great for those too!) They are about spreading opportunities to enter every trade possible, in away that allows the employer to specify your training. Currently nearly 70% of occupations can now be entered via an apprenticeship – and we intend to build on this! Apprenticeships should be part of the conversation at every Sixth Form careers fair, and whenever businesses seek to hire specific skills.The LevyTo build an Apprenticeships Nation, these qualifications needed to be fully and intelligently financed. We met this challenge by asking the employers with the deepest pockets to contribute to high quality training. The Apprenticeship Levy came into effect in 2017; it has allowed us to double apprenticeships spending in cash terms, from £1.2 billion in 2010-11 to £2.5 billion in 2022-23. To keep pace with the cost of living last year, IfATE awarded funding uplifts to almost 80 apprenticeship standards, by an average of 35%. And to ensure apprentices gain vital skills, we recently increased the apprenticeship funding rate for English and maths tuition by 54%.In 2024-25, we will spend £2.7 billion on high-quality apprenticeships.I’m passionate about the Apprenticeship Levy, and not just because of the money it brings in!Putting a statutory obligation on big companies to contribute to the programme has really helped shift the culture in how apprenticeships are perceived and who offers them. It’s why I don’t agree with calls to spend the Levy on other skills training. Fewer apprentices would be employed, with more people doing shorter qualifications of varying quality. Using half of Levy funds in this way could have resulted in around 60% fewer apprentice starts last academic year.I’m determined that it will remain the Ronseal Levy that does what it says on the tin: supports employers to take-on more apprentices and invest in the high quality training needed for a skilled workforce.Degree ApprenticeshipsAn Apprenticeships Nation means extending this training up to degree level, at the best universities. Degree apprenticeships are so important because of their unique offer. Students benefit from brilliant collaborations between top businesses and world-class universities which fit them for a great career, pay them a wage, and don’t charge tuition fees. This is particularly valuable to people from disadvantaged backgrounds. A degree apprenticeship can act as a launchpad to a highly-paid job for someone without any background in that industry. Level 6 apprentices have median earnings of over £34,500 once they complete – demonstrating just how valuable these workers are to employers.Over 222,000 people have started on these prestigious training pathways since 2015. That’s remarkable – but I’m determined that these opportunities reach many, many more people. It’s why we’ve made up to £40 million available for universities to expand degree-level apprenticeships.Careers EducationBut to really build an Apprenticeships Nation, we must continue our revolution in careers provision.School pupils should have awareness of apprenticeships, and where they can take you, well before their tertiary choices at 16. That is why we strengthened the provider access legislation, known as the Baker Clause, via the Skills and Post-16 Education Act in 2022. We now stipulate that every school must provide pupils with a minimum of six education and training provider encounters, to build their understanding of what technical routes can offer.I am determined that students have more opportunities to see industries and occupations up close, and to learn about the benefits of technical routes and skills education. Over 95% of schools and colleges are now part of The Careers & Enterprise Company’s network of Careers Hubs, working with almost 400 major employers.  Our ASK programme is raising older pupils’ awareness of the benefits of apprenticeships and T Levels. It had 625,000 interactions with young people in over 2,400 schools in 2022/23.I’ve met with Sir Martyn Oliver since his appointment as the Chief Inspector of Ofsted, and he is fully onboard with this vital aspect of skills reform – that careers education fully educate pupils on all their options.Quality over Quantity ..but we still want more!My next goal for apprenticeships is quality over quantity. There is no point wracking-up huge numbers of participants if the training people receive is not second to none.To raise the prestige of vocational, technical education, we must ensure that these employer-led qualifications are to the highest standard.If you compare pre-2010 apprenticeships with 2024 apprenticeships, you’re not comparing apples and pears. You’re comparing apples with tortoises.There were fewer than half a million people participating in apprenticeships in 2009/10.Those training programmes had no requirement to last at least a year, and no minimum guided learning hours.Last year over 750,000 were participating – and training to the more rigorous, industry-designed standards we introduced from 2014.I know participation has fluctuated over the last decade, as high quality standards and the Levy were introduced.But quality matters more than quantity because it serves everyone in the long term – businesses, the economy and learners’ outcomes. Quality will help us to achieve our ambition of reaching a 67% achievement rate for apprenticeship by 2025.Government is sometimes accused of not thinking about the long term.I’m glad we did 10 years ago, at about the same time as the first Annual Apprenticeship Conference was being organised.Now, although I prioritise quality over quantity, quantity comes a close second.This academic year we’ve already seen over 160,000 apprenticeship starts, up 3% on the same period the previous year. Among those, the number of young people under 19 starting an apprenticeship is up by 6%, to over 50,000 starts. Overall, 65% of these starts are at Levels 2 & 3 – the crucial point at which young people may finish their education. An apprenticeship allows them to build to higher levels later if they chose.There have been nearly 27,000 apprenticeship starts at degree level in the first quarter, up 4% on same period last year. And the number of achievements is up 22% so far this academic year, with 37,400 people passing their apprenticeship.But that’s not enough!It won’t surprise you to hear I want as many people as possible to do apprenticeships.Social justiceMy final goal for apprenticeships is that they serve social justice.This is a core part of my personal mission in politics, and why I have such enthusiasm for this training.It is not fair that opportunities to enter good work, with progression and a rising pay scale are often not given to those who need them most.Apprenticeships provide a Ladder of Opportunity for people to climb to a better life – that’s why I champion them.I’m keen that we present apprenticeships to all kinds of candidates as an attractive, supported option. This includes young people who’ve spent time in care, and haven’t enjoyed a stable family life to guide decisions about their future. In August we raised the bursary for care-experienced apprentices to £3,000. These young people can now begin their training confident they can cover the living costs usually met by family. This is on top of the £1,000 available to both the employer and training provider who take on a care-experienced apprentice. It’s total of £5,000 additional funding for each young person who’s spent time in care, which will boost these apprentices’ outcomes.We know there are specific challenges to hiring younger apprentices, and those with health and learning conditions. That’s why we also provide an additional £1,000 of funding to employers and training providers who hire apprentices aged 19-24 with an Education, Health and Care Plan.The same subsidy is also available for hiring younger apprentices aged 16 to 18.And to further assist hiring candidates with an EHC plan, we have recently lowered the English and Maths requirements to ‘entry level 3’ for these apprentices.I also want to explore how we can help more disabled people to progress and complete their apprenticeship. That’s why we’ve begun a pilot scheme to help training providers offer quality mentoring to these individuals. It will give participants tailored support from someone who understands the apprenticeship programme, as well as their individual needs and circumstances.Social justice means making sure apprenticeships are offered as a choice to everyone who could benefit from them – particularly those unlikely to apply unless encouraged by their school or college.ConclusionWe set lofty goals when we began reforming the apprenticeships programme 10 years ago.I’m determined that we continue to set our sights high, to make apprenticeships better and better throughout the 2020s and 2030s.I have a picture in my office of John F Kennedy – the 35th President of the United States.Back in the 1960s, he also had high ambitions.He said: “We choose to go to the Moon … and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”His point was – that’s what makes it worthwhile! We could spend less money and time and effort, but we wouldn’t have a space programme – or an apprenticeships programme – to be proud of.I know this because I’ve been campaigning for these reforms for a long time.We’re doing it not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.We know that every apprenticeship undertaken, and every apprenticeship taken-on, means better prospects and security for the apprentice, and better business outcomes for the employer.Let me leave you with that high-flying thought.Thank you, and I hope you enjoy today’s conference.",Conservative
Nusrat Ghani,2024 Speech at the Make UK’s National Manufacturing Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/nusrat-ghani-2024-speech-at-the-make-uks-national-manufacturing-conference/,"The speech made by Nusrat Ghani, the Minister for Industry and Economic Security, at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London on 27 February 2024.Good morning and thank you to Make UK – not just for inviting to me to speak to you today but for your tireless work in both championing and celebrating the best of British manufacturing.We’re going to spend a lot of today talking about the innovations of tomorrow, and it’s right that we do so.But we can’t reflect on the future without first considering the present.Last Saturday marked two years since Vladimir Putin’s illegal, appalling invasion of Ukraine.The shockwaves of that invasion continue to reverberate around the world.Meanwhile, international shipping in the Red Sea has been undermined by unprovoked Houthi attacks.And the global economy continues to reel from the devastating effects of COVID.The lesson for us in all of this is the same one which has been hard learnt by the global energy sector in recent years. If the UK is to be safe, secure, and not at the whim of tyrants, key sectors of our economy must be able to stand on their own two feet.The days of Western economies outsourcing manufacturing to the cheapest option in far flung corners of the globe are over.And there is a growing recognition across the West that we must take steps toward being more self-sufficient, more self-determined.And we must do so in an increasingly competitive global environment.Every year my department analyses which countries are going to define the future of the world’s economy, not just over the next three years but over the next three decades.Naturally, we expect to see countries like China, India, and Brazil growing by leaps and bounds. But we are also likely to see some of the world’s smaller economies like Bangladesh growing into even bigger, global players.I know it’s become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the rise of these nations – especially in manufacturing – will precipitate our decline.In fact, nothing could be further from the truth….Look around this room and see the health of British manufacturing here today.What’s encouraging is that despite our varied pasts, everyone here is united in countering the defeatist narrative that the UK doesn’t ‘make anything anymore.’Because the exact opposite is true. We have always been and always will be a manufacturing powerhouse.The figures speak for themselves. Overall, the UK’s industrial sector has increased year on year over the last half century. We have consistently been one of the largest manufacturers in Europe and globally. And, according to the OECD, since 2010 the UK has had the fastest growing manufacturing sector in the G7.On a more personal level, through the businesses I’ve visited, the innovations I’ve witnessed and the entrepreneurs I speak with every day, I see a manufacturing sector which is not just surviving but thriving and driving growth throughout the UK.Supporting a thriving manufacturing sectorBut the world is changing faster than we ever realised possible. As everyone in this room is well aware the communications revolution of the last 50 years has precipitated a snowball effect of innovation.Whether it’s the rise of 3D printing, the advent of AI or space tourism, what was science fiction even two decades ago is fast becoming science fact.The truth is that if you want to stay in the game you’ve got to be ahead of the game.That’s why, along with my ministerial colleagues, I am focused on creating the right conditions where future-facing manufacturing businesses can thrive.Investing in skills through our flagship apprenticeship programme and boot camps…Building the resilience of our supply chains…And attracting investment into emerging technologies and green energy.The Advanced Manufacturing Plan is at the heart of this work.It sets out our ambition to make the UK the best place in the world, to start, grow and invest in manufacturing……An ambition backed by over £4.5bn of investment to continue our successful business programmes to 2030, including in vital sectors like aerospace, aviation, and offshore wind.And that sits alongside measures to support the whole sector – generous tax relief and business-boosting reforms like making full expensing for businesses permanent; something I know Make UK and others have long-called for.Alongside this work we’ve brought in five new Advanced Manufacturing investment zones each with an envelope of £160 million over ten years.So, we’re making progress and I’m pleased Make UK’s recent Executive Survey for 2024 reflects that too – a majority of manufacturers view the UK as a more competitive place compared with just a third in the previous year.However, I’m well aware that your report out today suggests a series of additional steps the Government should take. It’s a vital contribution to the debate on how we create a pro-business, innovation nation and we’ll be carefully reviewing its recommendations….For my part, I believe we’ll achieve that goal through striving towards three clear goals.Boosting innovation through investment….Building resilience so your businesses are ready for the future….And delivering for British businesses at home and abroad.Let me speak to each of these goals.Boosting investment and innovationFirst, investment. For every £1 of Government support for our manufacturing sector, we are leveraging £5 of additional private sector investment.You can see the tangible impact of that in our automotive sector. The backing of big global players like Nissan, who are set to build two new 100% electric models in their Sunderland plant this year.It’s a recipe for success we’ve seen replicated across the country and I’m proud that my department is driving that investment forward.We’ve worked with BMW to secure £600 million investment in the UK so more iconic Mini Coopers can roll off production lines in Oxfordshire.Meanwhile Ellesmere Port in Cheshire is primed to become our first EV-only factory ensuring that British marques like Jaguar and Land Rover can compete with the best of Tesla, General Motors and BYD.We’ve been just as ambitious – and just as proactive – in our aviation sector, supporting one of the biggest deals in the industry’s history with Air India – an order for 250 new Airbus aircraft.A similar deal between Airbus and Turkish Airlines will see 140, Rolls-Royce engines assembled and tested in Derby, fitted to the A350.These two deals, alone, are worth billions to the UK economy.As part of our journey not just to Net Zero, but Jet Zero, we’re ploughing just shy of one billion pounds over the next five years into R&D and our Aerospace Technology Institute Programme.At the same time, thanks to Government investment, Boeing are set to create a new aerospace facility at the Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre creating lightweight composite materials for planes and 8,000 well-paid jobs in the process.The UK built the Harrier, Concorde and the VC10.And with the pipeline of investment and talent we’re putting in place today, we will design the next generation of green, clean, aircraft tomorrow…When we think about the wealth of home-grown energy we can tap into – solar, wind, nuclear, hydrogen – this Government is taking an ‘all of the above’ approach to secure our energy independence.It’s why we have announced our Green Industries Growth Accelerator to decarbonise our energy system whilst ensuring British manufacturers can capitalise on the transition.And why, in areas where the UK truly exceeds like offshore wind, we are consulting on major reforms to bring in additional revenue.In Dogger Bank off the Yorkshire coast, the UK already boasts the largest offshore wind farm in the world.And while China and the US might be hot on our heels, we’re crowding in the investment so that we always stay ahead of the pack.Because when it comes to green manufacturing, our aim is to not to keep up, it is to lead.That’s why we’ve convened a Battery Strategy Taskforce comprising academic and industry leaders to help the UK press ahead with achieving a globally competitive battery supply chain by 2030.It’s why the best and brightest of our nation are coming together to invent new solutions for business.  The SUSTAIN Future Manufacturing Research Hub, in which Swansea and Warwick Universities are key partners, is just one of the research projects working right now to decarbonise and improve the efficiency of industry in the UK.And soon, I will be co-chairing the very first Hydrogen Propulsion Manufacturing Taskforce – which includes leading manufacturing businesses like your own…Helping us realise the economic and environmental opportunities of hydrogen propulsion technologies in transport.Building resilienceNext, I want to turn to how we’re building resilience for manufacturers.We are not naïve about the scale of the challenges manufacturers – really all manufacturing nations throughout the western world – will face over the next half century.The UK is and will always be a proud champion of free, fair, global trade.But that doesn’t mean dependence.It doesn’t mean reliance on countries that do not always have our best interests at heart.It’s why the UK recently became the first ever country to publish a Critical Imports and Supply Chains Strategy – working hand-in-glove with our strategies on semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals.This 18-point action plan will enable us to minimise the impacts of supply chain shocks for British business…But we’re also focused on helping British manufacturing businesses meet a changing world.On that note, I know the last few months have been exceptionally difficult for the people of Port Talbot – for everyone affected by Tata Steel’s modernisation plans.We’re making sure there is a proper strategy in place – a transition board – to help people and the local communities throughout this process while investing half a billion pounds for a new, modern electric arc furnace. This is one of the biggest industrial support packages in our nation’s history, that will also act as a catalyst for more opportunities in South Wales, especially when connected with the Celtic Freeport.It will also mean we can use scrap materials sourced right here in the UK, so we can reduce our reliance on importing raw materials.In short, the plan we’re funding with Tata will help the steelworks finally move from loss to profit and ensure Port Talbot remains a steel-making town for generations to come.This is a clear illustration of how Government and industry can work together to make sure UK manufacturing can compete and thrive in the 21st Century.And that leads to how we are helping to deliver for manufacturing businesses at home and abroad…One example is the way we are pressing ahead with our Innovation Accelerator, which I am co-chairing alongside Brian Holliday from Siemens Digital.This will bring together leaders in AI technology with a cross section of manufacturing companies – raising productivity, increasing sustainability, and boosting competitiveness for companies of all shapes and sizes……Because you and I know that our biggest manufacturers are supported by an army of smaller businesses.And in this, the Government’s Year of the SME, we’re even more conscious than ever that those companies have the right skills and knowledge to succeed…It’s why we’ve pumping up to £16 million into our Made Smarter programme – so SMEs across every English region can get ready for a digital future…And I can’t overstate the difference the scheme is making….Take JIG UK – a bathroom producer – just one of hundreds of firms that are benefitting.As a result of the Made Smarter programme its capacity hasn’t just doubled it has tripled…Macalloy, a global manufacturer of tension bars and rod systems is another winner from the programme.  Thanks to Made Smarter it can now produce digital diagnostic tools and has completely transformed their business.I would encourage any entrepreneur or manufacturer looking to innovate, streamline and drive efficiency to get in touch with my department and discuss how the Made Smarter programme can help you and your business.So, we’re delivering for British manufacturers in the UK, ensuring the right investment and support is in place at the right time.But we’re also working hard so that more British-designed, British-made goods can be sold abroad, too.Our ‘Made in the UK, Sold to the World Programme’ is helping UK manufacturers double exports and sell their products around the globe with a clear target of hitting a £1 trillion of exports by 2030.Six years out, and we’re already within touching distance of that goal.We have negotiated free trade agreements with 73 countries from Mexico to Malaysia, lowering tariffs and market access barriers on thousands of UK-made goods.Our trade deals with Australia and New Zealand – the first to be negotiated from scratch after Brexit – are already seeing homegrown British businesses breaking into new markets on the other side of the world.We want to get even more trade agreements with big international partners over the line, including India – the future third largest economy with over one billion potential consumers of UK products, from Bromley bicycles to Barbour jackets.So let me sum up by saying: that my job is to help you do your jobs.Creating the best possible conditions for UK manufacturing to not only thrive but to lead the rest of the world.At the end of the day though – what makes British manufacturing so successful is all of you. It’s brilliant organisations like Make UK.And I have no doubt that together we can work hard to make sure that Britain’s future as a powerhouse of manufacturing is guaranteed now and for many generations to come.Thank you.",Conservative
Theresa May,2024 Statement Announcing Standing Down at General Election,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-may-2024-statement-announcing-standing-down-at-general-election/,"The statement made by Theresa May, the former Prime Minister, on 8 March 2024.Being an MP is about service to one’s constituents and I have always done my best to ensure that I respond to the needs of local people and the local area. Since stepping down as Prime Minister I have enjoyed being a backbencher again and having more time to work for my constituents and champion causes close to my heart including most recently launching a Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking. These causes have been taking an increasing amount of my time. Because of this, after much careful thought and consideration, I have realised that, looking ahead, I would no longer be able to do my job as an MP in the way I believe is right and my constituents deserve.

Jeremy Hunt,2024 Budget Speech,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/jeremy-hunt-2024-budget-speech/,"The speech made by Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons on 6 March 2024.As we mourn the tragic loss of life in Israel and Gaza, the Prime Minister reminded us last week of the need to fight extremism and heal divisions, so I start today by remembering the Muslims who died in two world wars in the service of freedom and democracy. We need a memorial to honour them, so following representations from my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sir Sajid Javid) and others, I have decided to allocate £1 million towards the cost of building one. Whatever your faith, colour or class, this country will never forget the sacrifices made for our future.In recent times, the UK—and the UK economy—has dealt with a financial crisis, a pandemic and an energy shock caused by war in Europe, yet despite the most challenging economic headwinds in modern history, under Conservative Governments since 2010 growth has been higher than in every large European economy, unemployment has halved, absolute poverty has gone down, and there are 800 more people in jobs for every single day that we have been in office. [Interruption.] Of course, interest rates remain high as we bring down inflation, but because of the progress we have made, because we are delivering the Prime Minister’s economic priorities, we can now help families not just with temporary cost of living support, but with permanent cuts in taxation. We do that to give much needed help in challenging times, and because Conservatives know that lower tax means higher growth, and higher growth means more opportunity, more prosperity and more funding for our precious public services. [Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. The Chancellor has hardly said anything—[Interruption.] Order. You cannot get excited yet. Other people want to hear what the Chancellor has to say. It matters, so we will have a bit of good behaviour, please.Jeremy HuntThank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.If we want that growth to lead to higher wages and higher living standards for every family in every corner of the country, it cannot come from unlimited migration; it can only come by building a high-wage, high-skill economy—not just higher GDP, but higher GDP per head.That is the difference. The Labour party’s plans would destroy jobs, reduce opportunities and risk family finances with spending that pushes up taxes. Instead of going back to square one, the policies I announce today mean more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes in a Budget for long-term growth.I start with the updated forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, for which I thank Richard Hughes and his team. First, inflation. When the Prime Minister and I came into office, it was 11%. The latest figures show—[Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. This is not amusing any more. We need to hear what the Chancellor has to say. I can tell who is making the noise, and you simply will not get a chance to speak later. That is the end of it.Jeremy HuntWhen the Prime Minister and I came into office, inflation was 11%, but the latest figures show it is now 4%—more than meeting our pledge last year to halve it. Today’s forecasts from the OBR show it falling below the 2% target in just a few months’ time, nearly a whole year earlier than forecast in the autumn statement.That did not happen by accident. Whatever the pressures, and whatever the politics, a Conservative Government, working with the Bank of England, will always put sound money first. We also understand that tackling inflation, while necessary, is painful. It means higher interest rates and a period of lower growth, so we have given the average household £3,400 in cost of living support over the past two years. Doing so makes economic as well as moral sense. The OBR predicted real household disposable income per person would fall by 2% in the past year; instead, after that support, it is on track to rise by 0.8%.Today, I take further steps to help families with cost of living pressures, starting with measures to help the poorest families. We have already abolished higher charges for electricity paid by those on prepayment meters, increased the local housing allowance and raised benefits by double the expected inflation. Today, I focus on those falling into debt. Nearly 1 million households on universal credit take out budgeting advance loans to pay for more expensive emergencies such as boiler repairs or help getting a job. To help make such loans more affordable, I have decided to increase the repayment period for new loans from 12 months to 24 months.For some people—[Interruption.] I thought Labour Members cared about people on the lowest incomes, but trust them not to want to hear about debt. For some people the best way to resolve debt is through a debt relief order, but getting one costs £90, which can deter the very people who need them most, so, having listened carefully to representations from Citizens Advice, I today relieve pressure on around 40,000 families every year by abolishing that £90 charge completely.Next, the household support fund. It was set up on a temporary basis and due to conclude at the end of this month. Having listened carefully to representations from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Trussell Trust, the right hon. Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms), my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) and my hon. Friends the Members for Colchester (Will Quince) and for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (David Simmonds) among others, I have decided that, with the battle against inflation still not over, now is not the time to stop the targeted help that it offers. We will therefore continue it at current levels for another six months.Next, I turn to a measure that will help businesses and households more broadly. In the autumn statement I froze alcohol duty until August of this year. Without any action today, it would have been due to rise by 3%. However, I have listened carefully to my right hon. Friends for Altrincham and Sale West (Sir Graham Brady) and for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns), and to my hon. Friend the Member for Moray (Douglas Ross), who is a formidable champion of the Scottish whisky industry. I also listened to Councillor John Tonks from Ash—a strong supporter of the wonderful Admiral pub—who pointed out the pressures facing the industry. Today, I have decided to extend the alcohol duty freeze until February 2025. That will benefit 38,000 pubs across the UK, on top of the £13,000 saving that a typical pub will get from the 75% business rates discount that I announced in the autumn. We value our hospitality industry. We are backing the great British pub.Another cost that families and businesses worry about is fuel. The shadow Chancellor complained about the freeze on fuel duty. Labour has opposed it at every opportunity. The Labour Mayor of London wants to punish motorists even more with his ultra low emission zone plans. However, lots of families and sole traders depend on their car. If I did nothing, fuel duty would increase by 13% this month, so instead I have listened to my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel), my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent North (Jonathan Gullis) and for Dudley North (Marco Longhi) and others, as well as to The Sun newspaper’s “Keep it Down” campaign. I have as a result decided to maintain the 5p cut and freeze fuel duty for another 12 months. That will save the average car driver £50 next year and bring total savings since the 5p cut was introduced to around £250. Taken together with the alcohol duty freeze, that decision also reduces headline inflation by 0.2 percentage points in 2024-25, allowing us to make faster progress towards the Bank of England’s 2% target.There can be no solid growth without solid finances. An economy based on sound money does not pass its bills to the next generation. When it comes to borrowing, some believe that there is a trade-off between compassion and fiscal responsibility. They are wrong. It is only because we responsibly reduced the deficit by 80% between 2010 and 2019 that we could provide £370 billion to help businesses and families in the pandemic. Labour opposed our plans to reduce the deficit every single step of the way, but, to be fair, they were consistent. In coalition, the Lib Dems supported controlling spending, but now they say that they would prop up a party that will turn on the spending taps. It is the difference between no plan and no principles—and I am delighted that, for once, the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Ed Davey) is here to hear that.Today, we say something different: there is nothing compassionate about running out of money. With the pandemic behind us, we must once again be responsible and build up our resilience to future shocks. That means bringing down borrowing so we can start to reduce our debt, and today’s figures confirm that is happening. Ahead of my first autumn statement in 2022, the OBR forecast that headline debt would rise to above 100% of GDP. Today, it says that it will fall in every year, to just 94% by 2028-29. According to the OBR, underlying debt—which excludes Bank of England debt—will be 91.7% in 2024-25, then 92.8%, 93.2% and 93.2%, before falling to 92.9% in 2028-29, with final year headroom against debt falling of £8.9 billion. Our underlying debt is therefore on track to fall as a share of GDP, meeting our fiscal rule, and we continue to have the second lowest level of Government debt in the G7, lower than that of Japan, France or the United States.We also meet our second fiscal rule—for public sector borrowing to be below 3% of GDP—three years early. Borrowing falls from 4.2% of GDP in 2023-24 to 3.1%, then 2.7%, 2.3%, 1.6%, and 1.2% in 2028-29. By the end of the forecast, borrowing is at its lowest level of GDP since 2001. None of that, of course, would be possible if Labour implemented its pledge to decarbonise the grid five years early, by 2030; by its own calculations, that costs £28 billion a year to do. Last month, after flip-flopping for months, Labour said that it is not going to spend the £28 billion after all, but will somehow meet its pledge. “Somehow” can only mean one thing: tax rises on working families. Same old Labour!Today, in contrast, a Conservative Government bring down taxes with borrowing broadly unchanged—in fact, borrowing is slightly lower than in the autumn statement. The fact that we are bringing borrowing down is of particular importance to one very special person: Sir Robert Stheeman is the outgoing chief executive of the Government’s Debt Management Office, and after 20 years of exceptional public service, he is in the Gallery. Thank you, Sir Robert.I now turn to growth. Just after I became Chancellor, the OBR expected GDP to fall by 1.4% in the following year; in fact it grew, albeit slowly. Now the OBR expects the economy to grow by 0.8% this year and 1.9% next year, which is 0.5% higher than its autumn forecast. After that, growth rises to 2.2%, 1.8%, and 1.7% in 2028. [Interruption.] Opposition Members do not want to hear this, but these are the facts. Since 2010, we have grown faster than Germany, France or Italy—the three largest European economies—and according to the International Monetary Fund, we will continue to grow faster than all three of them in the five years ahead. Surveys by Lloyds and Deloitte show that business confidence is returning. In other words, because we have turned the corner on inflation, we will soon turn the corner on growth.Today’s OBR forecasts also show that we have made good progress on the Prime Minister’s three economic priorities. Compared to when the three pledges were made, inflation has halved, debt is falling in line with our fiscal rules, and growth is fully 1.5 percentage points higher than predicted. [Interruption.] Labour Members do not have a growth plan, so they might as well listen to ours. As growth returns, our plan is for economic growth, not growth sustained through migration, but growth that raises wages and living standards for families—not just higher GDP, but higher GDP per head. That means sticking to our plan, with a Budget for long-term growth: more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes.I start with investment. Economists say that stimulating investment is the most effective way to raise productivity, and therefore wages and living standards. Since 2010, we have been doing just that. Business—[Interruption.] Labour Members might want to listen to what I am about to say, because business investment has risen from an average of 9.3% of GDP under Labour to 9.9% under the Conservatives. This year, it will be 10.6% of GDP. That is £30 billion more business investment than if it had continued at Labour levels, and it is still going up.In the short period since the autumn statement, Nissan has announced that it will build two new electric car models in the UK. Microsoft and Google have announced data centres worth over £3 billion. Thanks to my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary, the global investment summit unlocked £30 billion of investment. In fact, since 2010, greenfield foreign direct investment has been higher here than anywhere else in Europe, and for the last three years the UK has had the third highest levels in the world after the United States and China—and we are not stopping there.In the autumn statement, I announced that we would introduce permanent full expensing, a £10 billion tax cut for businesses that gives the UK the most attractive investment tax regime of any large European or G7 country. It was welcomed by over 200 business leaders, with the CBI saying it was a game changer and the single most transformational thing we could do to fire up the British economy. Today, I take further steps to boost investment. Having listened to calls from the CBI, Make UK and the British Chambers of Commerce, we will shortly publish draft legislation for full expensing to apply to leased assets, a change I intend to bring in as soon as it is affordable.We will also help small businesses, which is something close to my heart. As well as the business rates support, and the work on prompt payments that I announced in the autumn, I will provide £200 million of funding to extend the recovery loan scheme as it transitions to the growth guarantee scheme, helping 11,000 small and medium-sized enterprises access the finance they need. Following representations from the Federation of Small Businesses, as well as my hon. Friends the Members for Loughborough (Jane Hunt), for Southend West (Anna Firth), and for Rother Valley (Alexander Stafford), I will reduce the administrative and financial impact of VAT by increasing the VAT registration threshold from £85,000 to £90,000 from 1 April—the first increase in seven years. That will bring tens of thousands of businesses out of paying VAT altogether, and encourage many more to invest and grow.I now move to measures to address historical under-investment in our nations and regions. Since we started levelling up in 2019, two thirds of all new salaried jobs created have been outside London and the south-east. We have announced 13 investment zones and 12 freeports, which continue to attract investment—including recently, thanks to the efforts of Mayor Ben Houchen, from the Pneuma Group, which is investing £15 million into the Tees Valley investment zone.Today, working with the Levelling-Up Secretary, I devolve further power to local leaders, who are best placed to promote growth in their areas. I can announce the north-east trailblazer devolution deal, which provides a package of support for the region potentially worth over £100 million. I will devolve powers to Buckinghamshire, Warwickshire and the most beautiful county in England, Surrey. I see the Leader of the Opposition smiling because, like me, he is a Surrey boy. I know he has been taking advice from Lord Mandelson, who yesterday rather uncharitably said he needed to “shed a few pounds”. Ordinary families will shed more than a few pounds if that lot get in. If he wants to join me on my marathon training, he is most welcome.Today, we continue to spread opportunity throughout the country by allocating £100 million of levelling-up funding to areas including High Peak, Dundee, Conwy, Erewash, Redditch and Coventry to support cultural projects in these communities. That is alongside support for capital projects across the country, including in Bingley. We are expanding the long-term plan for towns to 20 new places, including Darlington—home of the Treasury’s fantastic Darlington economic campus—Coleraine, Peterhead, Runcorn, Harlow, Eastbourne, Arbroath and Rhyl, providing each with £20 million of funding to invest in community regeneration over the next decade. We will provide £15 million in new funding to the West Midlands Combined Authority to support culture, heritage and investment projects, on the recommendation of our go-getting Mayor, Andy Street, and we will allocate £5 million to renovate hundreds of local village halls across England, so that they can remain at the heart of their communities.Because this is a Conservative and Unionist Government, we will also set aside funding to support the SaxaVord spaceport in Shetland and an agrifood launchpad in mid-Wales, and funding to support Northern Ireland’s businesses in expanding their global trade and investment opportunities. As a result of the decisions we take today, the Scottish Government will receive nearly £300 million in Barnett consequentials; there will be nearly £170 million for the Welsh Government and £100 million for the Northern Ireland Executive. [Interruption.] I do appreciate that a tax-cutting Budget is very uncomfortable for the biggest tax-raisers in the United Kingdom. We also want to level up opportunity across the generations, including by building more houses for young people, and we are on track to deliver over 1 million homes in this Parliament.Last week, the Levelling-Up Secretary allocated £188 million to supporting projects in Sheffield, Blackpool and Liverpool. Today I go further, allocating £242 million of investment to Barking Riverside and Canary Wharf, which together will build nearly 8,000 houses; Canary Wharf will also be transformed into a new hub for life science companies. We are launching a new £20 million community-led housing scheme that will support local communities in delivering the developments that they want and need. I am pleased to announce the next steps for Cambridge to reach its potential as the world’s leading scientific powerhouse. I confirm that there will be a long-term funding settlement for the future development corporation in Cambridge at the next spending review; there will be over £10 million invested in the coming year to unlock delivery of crucial local transport and health infrastructure.The final levelling-up measures I announce today support north Wales, of which I have many happy childhood memories. In Mold, following representations from my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Dr Davies), we will help fund the renovation of Theatr Clywd. I can announce that this week, the Government have reached agreement on a £160 million deal with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site in Ynys Môn and the Oldbury site in south Gloucestershire. Ynys Môn has a vital role in delivering our nuclear ambitions, and no one should take more credit for today’s announcement than my tireless, tenacious and turbocharged hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn (Virginia Crosbie). More investment by large businesses, more support for small businesses, promoting investment in our nations and regions—all part of a Budget for long-term growth that sticks to our plan to deliver more jobs, better public services and lower taxes.I turn to one of the most powerful ways to attract investment: supporting our most innovative industries. Outside the US, we have the most respected universities, the biggest financial services sector and the largest tech ecosystem in Europe. We have double the artificial intelligence start-ups of anywhere else in Europe, double the venture capital investment, and a tech economy now double the size of Germany’s and three times the size of France’s. We are on track to become the world’s next silicon valley.In today’s Budget for long-term growth, I take further steps to attract investment to our technology-related industries. I want our brilliant tech entrepreneurs to not just start here, but stay here, including when the time comes for a stock market listing, so we will build on the Edinburgh and Mansion House reforms to unlock more pension fund capital. We will give new powers to the Pensions Regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure better value from defined contribution schemes by judging performance on overall returns, not cost.We will make sure that there are vehicles to make it easier for pension funds to invest in UK growth opportunities, so I am today publishing the names of the winners of the LIFTS—long-term investment for technology and science—competition. But I remain concerned that other markets, such as Australia, generate better returns for pension savers, with more effective investment strategies and more investment in high-quality domestic growth stocks. So I will introduce new requirements for defined-contribution and local government pension funds to disclose publicly their level of international and UK equity investments. I will then consider what further action should be taken if we are not on a positive trajectory towards international best practice.I also want to create opportunities for a new generation of retail investors to engage with public markets, so we will proceed with a retail sale for part of the Government’s remaining NatWest shares this summer, at the earliest opportunity, subject to supportive market conditions and value for money. We will continue to explore how savers could be allowed to take their pension pots with them when they change job. We will make it easier for people to save for the long term with a new British savings bond, delivered through National Savings and Investments, offering savers a guaranteed rate, fixed for three years.Today, following calls from over 200 representatives of the City and our high-growth sectors, I will reform the ISA system to encourage more people to invest in UK assets. After a consultation on its implementation, I will introduce a brand-new British ISA, which will allow an additional £5,000 annual investment for investments in UK equity, with all the tax advantages of other ISAs. That will be on top of existing ISA allowances and will ensure that British savers can benefit from the growth of the most promising UK businesses, as well as supporting those businesses with the capital to expand.I now turn to our other growth industries, starting with clean energy. We want nuclear to provide up to a quarter of our electricity by 2050. As part of that, I want the UK to lead the global race in developing cutting-edge nuclear technologies. I can therefore announce that Great British Nuclear will begin the next phase of the small modular reactor selection process, with companies now having until June to submit their initial tender responses. Our brilliant Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero will also allocate up to £120 million more to the green industries growth accelerator, to build supply chains for new technology, ranging from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage. By January next year, as promised in the autumn statement, we will have a new, faster connections process to the grid up and running. In advanced manufacturing we have announced a further £270 million of investment into innovative new automotive and aerospace research and development projects, building the UK’s capabilities in zero-emission vehicle and clean aviation technologies.I now turn to our creative industries. We have become Europe’s largest film and TV production centre, with Idris Elba, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom all filming their latest productions here. Studio space in the UK has doubled over the last three years and, at the current rate of expansion, next year we will be second only to Hollywood globally. In the autumn statement I committed to providing more tax relief for visual effects in film and high-end TV. I can today confirm that we will increase the rate of tax credit by 5%, and remove the 80% cap for visual effects costs in the audio-visual expenditure credit. Having worked closely with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and listened carefully to representations from companies such as Pinewood, Warner Bros. and Sky Studios, we will provide eligible film studios in England with a 40% relief on their gross business rates until 2034. Having heard representations from the British film industry, Pact, and indeed the Prime Minister, we will introduce a new tax credit for UK independent films with a budget of less than £15 million. For our creative industries more broadly, we will provide £26 million of funding to our pre-eminent theatre, the National Theatre, to upgrade its stages.I particularly want to recognise the contribution of our creative industries and the tourism that comes from orchestras, museums, galleries and theatres. In the pandemic, we introduced higher 45% and 50% levels of tax relief, which were due to end in March 2025. They have been a lifeline for performing arts across the country. Today, in recognition of their vital importance to our national life, I can announce that I am making those tax reliefs permanent at 45% for touring and orchestral productions, and 40% for non-touring productions. Lord Lloyd Webber says that this will be a once-in-a-generation transformational change that will ensure Britain remains the global capital of creativity.I suspect that the new theatre reliefs may be of particular interest to the shadow Chancellor, who seems to fancy her thespian skills when it comes to acting like a Tory. The trouble is that we all know how her show ends: higher taxes, like every Labour Government in history—[Interruption.] I am delighted that Labour Members are cheering the fact that Labour Governments always put up taxes. They are right!I want to mention our life sciences sector, where we will support research by medical charities into diseases such as cancer, dementia and epilepsy with an additional £45 million, including £3 million for Cancer Research UK. But I have long believed that we should be manufacturing medicines as well as developing them, so I can today also announce a brand-new investment by one of our greatest life science companies, AstraZeneca, led by mon ami the irrepressible Sir Pascal Soriot. AstraZeneca made its covid vaccine available to developing countries at cost, as a result saving over 6 million lives. Today, because of the Government’s support for the life sciences sector, it has announced plans to invest £650 million in the UK to expand its footprint on the Cambridge biomedical campus, and fund the building of a vaccine manufacturing hub in Speke in Liverpool. That is more investment and better jobs in every corner of the country in a long-term Budget for growth from a Conservative Government.One of the biggest barriers to investment is businesses not being able to hire the staff they need. The economy today has around 900,000 vacancies. It would be easy to fill them with higher migration, but with over 10 million adults of working age who are not in work, that would be economically and morally wrong. Those who can work should work, and I have tackled that issue in every Budget and autumn statement I have delivered. A year ago, I abolished the pensions lifetime allowance, which had pushed doctors and others to take early retirement. Ask any doctor what they think about Labour’s plans to bring it back and they will say, “Don’t go back to square one.” In the autumn, with the help of our superb Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, we announced the back to work plan, which will support 1 million adults with medical conditions and reduce the number of people assessed as not needing to work by two thirds.A year ago, I also announced the biggest ever expansion of childcare—[Interruption.] Just listen. Extending the 30-hour free childcare offer to all children of working parents from nine months. [Interruption.] We have not had a childcare plan from Labour, so Opposition Members might want to listen to ours. Our plan will mean an extra 60,000 parents enter the workforce in the next four years—a tremendous achievement for the Education Secretary, who I think is doing an effing good job. Today, following representations from many people, including the CBI, I announce measures to support the childcare sector to make the new investments it now needs to make. I am guaranteeing the rates that will be paid to childcare providers to deliver our landmark offer for children over nine months old for the next two years. That is more people in work and more jobs, sticking to our plan in a long-term Budget for growth.I now turn to public services. [Interruption.] I thought they were supposed to be interested in public services—[Interruption.] I can wait.Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Eleanor Laing)Order. A little bit of murmuring is normal, but I should not be able to hear what Members are saying over there. That is clearly out of order. Let us have some courtesy.Jeremy HuntThank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.Good public services need a strong economy to pay for them, but a strong economy also needs good public services. In 2010, schools in the UK were behind Germany, France and Sweden in the OECD’s PISA—programme for international student assessment—education rankings for reading and maths. Now, after Conservative reforms, we are ahead of them. Burglaries and violent crime have halved in the last 14 years after we invested in 20,000 more police officers. Our armed forces remain the most professional and best-funded in Europe, with defence spending already more than 2% of GDP. We are providing more military support to Ukraine than nearly any other country, and our spending will rise to 2.5% as soon as economic conditions allow. The NHS is still recovering from the pandemic but has 42,000 more doctors and 71,000 more nurses than it did under Labour—that is 250 more doctors and 400 more nurses for every single month that we have been in office.Resources matter, of course, which is why, despite all the economic shocks we have faced, overall spending on public services has gone up since 2010—in the case of the NHS, by more than a third in real terms. Although spending has continued to rise every year, public sector productivity still remains below pre-pandemic levels by nearly 6%. This demonstrates that the way to improve public services is not always more money or more people; we also need to run them more efficiently. We need a more productive state, not a bigger state.In autumn 2022, I set day-to-day spending to increase by 1% a year in real terms over the next Parliament. Some say that is not enough and we should raise spending by more, and others say it is too much and we should cut it to improve efficiency—neither are right. It is not fair to ask taxpayers to pay for more when public service productivity has fallen; nor would it be wise to reduce that funding, given the pressures that public services face. So I am keeping the planned growth in day-to-day spending at 1% in real terms, but we are going to spend it better. [Interruption.] The Opposition do not have a plan for public services, as with everything else, so why not listen to ours?Today I am announcing a landmark public sector productivity plan that restarts public service reform and changes the Treasury’s traditional approach to public spending. I start with our biggest and most important public service: the NHS. One of my greatest privileges was to be Health Secretary. Thanks to the NHS, I have three gorgeous children, the oldest of whom has been patiently listening in the Gallery. The NHS is, rightly, the biggest reason most of us are proud to be British, but the systems that support its staff are often antiquated. Doctors, nurses and ward staff spend hours every day filling out forms when they could be looking after patients. [Interruption.]Madam Deputy Speaker (Dame Eleanor Laing)Order. I do not like to interrupt the Chancellor, but Mr Streeting, you are too close to me to be shouting that loudly. If you want to shout that loudly, you should go away and sit up there. I apologise for interrupting the Chancellor.Jeremy HuntWhen patients do not show up or one member of a team is ill, operating theatres are left empty despite long waiting lists. When we published the NHS long-term workforce plan, I asked the NHS to put together a plan to transform its efficiency and productivity. I wanted better care for patients, more job satisfaction for staff and better value for taxpayers. Making changes on the scale we need is not cheap. The investment needed to modernise NHS IT systems so they are as good as the best in the world costs £3.4 billion, but it helps unlock £35 billion of savings—ten times that amount—so in today’s Budget for long-term growth, I have decided to fund the NHS productivity plan in full.With that new investment, we will slash the 13 million hours lost by doctors and nurses every year to outdated IT systems. We will cut down and potentially halve form filling by doctors by using artificial intelligence. We will digitise operating theatre processes, allowing the same number of consultants to do an extra 200,000 operations a year. We will fund improvements to help doctors read MRI and CT scans more accurately and quickly, speeding up results for 130,000 patients every year and saving thousands of lives, something that I know would have delighted my brother Charlie, who I recently lost to cancer.We will improve the NHS app so that it can be used to confirm and modify all appointments, reducing up to half a million missed appointments annually and improving patient choice. We will set up a new NHS staff app to make it easier to roster electronically and end the use of expensive off-framework agencies. As a result of this funding, all hospitals will use electronic patient records, making the NHS the largest digitally integrated healthcare system in the world. Today’s announcement doubles the amount the NHS is investing on digital transformation over three years.On top of this longer-term transformation, we will also help the NHS meet pressures in the coming year with an additional £2.5 billion. That will allow the NHS to continue its focus on reducing waiting times and brings the total increase in NHS funding since the start of the Parliament to 13% in real terms. The NHS was there for us in the pandemic, and today with nearly £6 billion of additional funding, a Conservative Government are there for the NHS.The head of the NHS, Amanda Pritchard today said that this investment shows that“the government continues to back the NHS”.She said that, as a result of the investment, the NHS can commit to delivering 1.9% annual productivity growth over the next Parliament, more than double the average productivity growth in public services between 2010 and 2019.But today is not just about the NHS. I want this groundbreaking agreement with the NHS to be a model for all our public services. Across education, the police, the courts and local government, I want to see more efficient, better-value and higher-quality public services, so today I can announce that in the next spending review, the Treasury will do things differently. We will prioritise proposals that deliver annual savings within five years equivalent to the total cost of the investment required, and today we make a start with some excellent proposals.Violence reduction units and hotspot policing have prevented an estimated 136,000 knife crimes and other violent offences, as well as over 3,000 hospital admissions. Every crime costs money, so we will provide £75 million to roll that model out in England and Wales. Police officers waste around eight hours a week on unnecessary admin. With higher productivity, we could free the equivalent of 20,000 police officers over a year. We will spend £230 million rolling out time-saving and money-saving technology that speeds up police response times by allowing people to report crimes by video call and, where appropriate, use drones as first responders.Too many legal cases, particularly in family law, should never go to court, and it would cost us less if they did not, so we will spend £170 million to fund non-court resolution, reduce reoffending and digitise the court process. Too many children in care end up being looked after by unregistered providers that are much more expensive, so we will invest £165 million over the next four years to reduce that cost by increasing the capacity of the children’s homes estate.Special educational need provision can be excellent when outsourced to independent sector schools, but also expensive, so we will invest £105 million over the next four years to build 15 new special free schools to create additional high-quality places and increase choice for parents. We will also put in place a plan to realise the tens of billions of savings recommended in an excellent speech by the head of the National Audit Office.The OBR says that a 5% increase in public sector productivity would be the equivalent of about £20 billion in extra funding. With these plans, we can deliver that and more. If we ensure that they are cash-releasing savings, as we are committed to doing, it will be possible to live with more constrained spending growth without cutting services valued by the public. So with the energy and drive of my talented Chief Secretary to the Treasury, we launch our public sector productivity plan in today’s Budget for long-term growth: more investment, more jobs, better public services and—one more thing—lower taxes.Keeping taxes down matters to Conservatives in a way that it never can for Labour. We believe that in a free society the money people earn does not belong to the Government; it belongs to them, and if we want to encourage hard work, we should let people keep as much of their own money as possible. Conservatives look around the world at economies in North America and Asia and notice that countries with lower taxes generally have higher growth. Economists argue about cause and correlation, but we know that lower-taxed economies have more energy, more dynamism and more innovation. We know that is Britain’s future, too.Before I explain how we will bring down taxes, I will start with some measures to make our system simpler and fairer. To discourage non-smokers from taking up vaping, we are today confirming the introduction of an excise duty on vaping products from October 2026 and publishing a consultation on its design. Because vapes can also play a positive role in helping people quit smoking, we will introduce a one-off increase in tobacco duty at the same time to maintain the financial incentive to choose vaping over smoking. I will make a one-off adjustment to rates of air passenger duty on non-economy flights only to account for high inflation in recent years, and I will provide HMRC with the resources it needs to ensure that everyone pays the tax they owe, leading to an increase in revenue collected of over £4.5 billion across the forecast period.Next, I turn to property taxation. In recent months, following tenacious representation from my hon. Friends the Members for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double), for North Devon (Selaine Saxby), for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken), for Torbay (Kevin Foster) and for Truro and Falmouth (Cherilyn Mackrory), I have been looking closely at our furnished holiday lettings tax regime. I am concerned that that regime is creating a distortion meaning that not enough properties are available for long-term rental by local people. So to make the tax system work better for local communities, I am going to abolish the furnished holiday lettings regime.I have also been looking at the stamp duty relief for people who purchase more than one dwelling in a single transaction, known as multiple dwellings relief. I see the deputy leader of the Labour party, the right hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner), paying close attention, given her multiple dwellings—[Interruption.] She—[Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. Too much excitement. We have not actually heard—because we cannot hear—what the Chancellor is trying to say. [Interruption.] Okay, I can hear who is shouting, and they will not get to speak later.Jeremy HuntI am sorry to disappoint the right hon. Member, but multiple dwellings relief was not actually designed for her; it was intended—[Interruption.]. It was intended to support investment in the private rented sector, but an external evaluation found no strong evidence that it had done so, and that it was being regularly abused, so I am going to abolish it.Finally, as part of our look at property taxation in this Budget, both the Treasury and the OBR have looked at the costs associated with our current levels of capital gains tax on property and concluded that if we reduced the higher 28% rate that exists for residential property, we would in fact increase revenues because there would be more transactions. For the first time in history, both the Treasury and the OBR have discovered their inner Laffer curve. So today I will reduce the higher rate of property capital gains tax from 28% to 24%—that really is for you, Angela. [Laughter.] I now—[Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. I have had enough from Opposition Members and I am definitely not having it from Government Members.Jeremy HuntI now turn to oil and gas. Unlike the Labour party, we want to encourage investment in the North sea, so we will retain generous investment allowances for the sector. Following representations from my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (David Duguid), we will also legislate in the Finance Bill to abolish the energy profits levy should market prices fall to their historical norm for a sustained period of time. But because the increase in energy prices caused by the Ukraine war is expected to last longer, so too will the sector’s windfall profits, so I will extend the sunset on the energy profits levy for an additional year to 2029, raising £1.5 billion.Next, I turn to the taxes paid by those who are resident in the UK but not domiciled here for tax purposes. [Hon. Members: “Ah!”] This is a category of people known as non-doms. Nigel Lawson wanted to end the non-dom regime in his great tax reforming Budget of 1988, which is where I suspect the Labour party got the idea from. I, too, have always believed that provided we protect the UK’s attractiveness to international investors, those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share. After looking at the issue over many months, I have concluded that we can indeed introduce a system that both is fairer and remains competitive with other countries, so the Government will abolish the current tax system for non-doms, get rid of the outdated concept of domicile—[Interruption.] I aim to please all parts of the House in all my Budgets. We will replace—[Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. This is impossible. [Interruption.] Order. Could you please shout more quietly? [Laughter.]Jeremy HuntWe will replace the non-dom regime with a modern, simpler and fairer residency-based system. From April 2025, new arrivals to the UK will not be required to pay any tax on foreign income and gains for their first four years of UK residency: a more generous regime than at present, and one of the most attractive offers in Europe. But, after four years, those who continue to live in the UK will pay the same tax as other UK residents.Recognising the contribution of many of these individuals to our economy, we will put in place transitional arrangements for those benefiting from the current regime. That will include a two-year period in which individuals will be encouraged to bring wealth earned overseas to the UK, so it can be spent and invested here—a measure that will attract onshore an additional £15 billion of foreign income and generate more than £1 billion of extra tax.Overall, abolishing non-dom status will raise £2.7 billion a year by the end of the forecast period. The Opposition planned to use that money for spending increases, but today a Conservative Government make a different choice. We use that revenue to help cut taxes on working families. Many of those families depend on child benefit, but the way that we treat child benefit in the tax system is confusing and unfair. It is a lifeline for many parents because it helps with the additional costs associated with having children. When it works, it is good for children, good for parents, and good for the economy because it helps people into work.We currently withdraw child benefit when one parent earns over £50,000 a year. That means that two parents earning £49,000 a year receive the benefit in full, but a household earning a lot less than that does not if just one parent earns over £50,000. Today I set out plans to end that unfairness. Doing so requires significant reform to the tax system, including allowing HMRC to collect household-level information. We will therefore consult on moving the high-income child benefit charge to a household-based system, to be introduced by April 2026. But because that is not a quick fix, I make two changes today to make the current system fairer.Following representations from my hon. Friends the Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates), for Carshalton and Wallington (Elliot Colburn), for Bassetlaw (Brendan Clarke-Smith) and for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin), along with many others, I confirm that from this April, the high-income child benefit charge threshold will be raised from £50,000 to £60,000. We will raise the top of the taper at which it is withdrawn to £80,000. That means that no one earning under £60,000 will pay the charge, taking 170,000 families out of paying it altogether. Because of the higher taper and threshold, nearly half a million families with children will save an average of £1,300 next year. According to the OBR, this change will see an increase in hours among those already working to the equivalent of 10,000 more people entering the workforce. More investment, more jobs, better public services and lower tax.There is one further set of changes that I want to make today. The way we tax people’s income is particularly unfair. Those who get their income from having a job pay two types of tax: national insurance contributions and income tax. Those who get it from other sources pay only one. This double taxation of work is unfair. The result is a complicated system that penalises work instead of encouraging it. If we are to build a high-wage, high-skill economy not dependent on migration and to encourage people not in work to come back to work, we need a simpler, fairer tax system that makes work pay. That is why I cut national insurance contributions in the autumn. By reducing the penalty on work, the OBR said that that tax cut would lead to the equivalent of 94,000 more people in work. In other words, it would fill more than one in 10 vacancies throughout the economy. Lower taxes, more jobs and higher growth.Today, because of the progress that we have made in bringing down inflation, because of the additional investment flowing into the economy, because we have a plan for better and more efficient public services, and because we have asked those with the broadest shoulders to pay a bit more—[Interruption.]Madam Deputy SpeakerOrder. Mr Perkins—[Interruption.] I can manage, thank you very much. I have heard you five times. I have let you get away with it, but that is enough. One more strike and you’re out.Jeremy HuntI know how hard it is for the Opposition to listen to arguments for lower taxes. That is the difference.Because we have asked those with the broadest shoulders to pay a bit more, today I go further. From 6 April, employee national insurance will be cut by another 2p, from 10% to 8%, and self-employed national insurance will be cut from 8% to 6%. That means an additional £450 a year for the average employee, or £350 for someone who is self-employed. When combined with the autumn reductions, it means 27 million employees will get an average tax cut of £900 a year, and 2 million of the self-employed will get a tax cut averaging £650. Those changes will make our system simpler and fairer, and will grow our economy by rewarding work. The OBR says that, when combined with the autumn reduction, our national insurance cuts will mean the equivalent of 200,000 more people in work—filling one in five vacancies, and adding 0.4% to GDP and 0.4% to GDP per head.This is the second fiscal event in which we have reduced employee and self-employed national insurance. We have cut it by one third in six months without increasing borrowing and without cutting spending on public services. That means that the average earner in the UK now has the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975. Their effective taxes are now lower than in America, France, Germany or any G7 country. Because Conservatives believe that making work pay is of the most fundamental importance, and because we believe that the double taxation of work is unfair, our long-term ambition is to end this unfairness. When it is responsible, when it can be achieved without increasing borrowing and when it can be delivered without compromising high-quality public services, we will continue to cut national insurance as we have done today, so that we truly make work pay.We stick to our plan with a Budget for long-term growth. It delivers more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes. However, dynamism in an economy does not come from Ministers in Whitehall but from the grit and determination of people who take risks, work hard and innovate—not Government policies but people power. It is to unleash people power that today we put this country back on a path to lower taxes: a plan to grow the economy versus no plan; a plan for better public services versus no plan; a plan to make work pay versus no plan. Growth up, jobs up and taxes down. I commend this statement to the House.",Conservative
David Rutley,2024 Speech on UK-US Fusion Energy ollaboration,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-rutley-2024-speech-on-uk-us-fusion-energy-ollaboration/,"The speech made by David Rutley, the Minister for the Americas, Caribbean and the Overseas Territories, in Boston, the United States on 20 February 2024.Well, good evening. It’s great to be with all of you and it’s fantastic to be back at Harvard Business School.What you didn’t say was that it was a long time ago – several decades ago to be perfectly honest.And this amazing building, well, I seem to remember it perhaps being a car park or something at that particular moment in time and it’s great to see how things are moving forward in B School, but also more widely here in this super vibrant part of the US.When I arrived here in 1987 – it was a long time ago – Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were leaders of the UK and the US.Now for some of you in this room, that’s ancient history but it was a reality at the time and I was just checking out to make sure that all of the points in my really heavy speech here were fact-checked.But the highest-grossing single – if any of you know what a single was – that year, was ‘Walk Like an Egyptian’ by the Bangles.It was that long ago, but what that shows is, is that things might change but the constant is that the output from places like HBS and MIT here is just phenomenal.It is a great honour, genuinely, to be asked here today, particularly on this all-important subject of fusion.We’re very grateful for everything you’re doing to develop and to promote, publicise, fusion technology; pushing the very frontiers of science and bringing what was once science fiction, particularly back in those days, to the very cusp of reality today.It’s really exciting to speak to some of you about your plans and the collaboration that is going on between the UK and the US.You know, we face great challenges today – climate change and rapidly-evolving geopolitical events have brought home the importance of ensuring our energy security and finding energy super-sources which are affordable, reliable, and sustainable.In this context, the world-changing potential of nuclear fusion for helping solve these challenges could not be clearer.Not only that, but commercialising fusion presents significant economic opportunities as well.If we get this right, we could deliver global energy security and decarbonisation, while also delivering abundant energy and economic growth for all our communities.That is why the UK has been leading the way in moving fusion energy forward.From the Culham Centre in Oxfordshire, which has been at the cutting edge of fusion science for almost 60 years, to the UK-based companies like Tokamak, who are pioneering commercial fusion energy.And just a few weeks ago, we announced that the UK-based Joint European Torus fusion reactor achieved a world record for energy output. It produced high fusion power consistently for five seconds, resulting in a ground-breaking record of 69 megajoules, using a mere 0.2 milligrams of fuel.The UK Government also launched a refreshed Fusion Energy Strategy in October, outlining our vision to support the fusion sector through investment, upskilling, and of course, that vital international collaboration.It includes up to £650 million in investment for a new ‘Fusion Futures Programme’.This Programme will fund a number of initiatives, like a fuel cycle testing facility to support fusion commercialisation, and new premises for private fusion companies at the Culham Centre.Education and training will drive the future of fusion.That’s why this Programme will fund a Fusion Skills Centre, which will train over 2,200 people by working with businesses and universities to increase the number of apprentices and postgraduates working on fusion.It will also have a significant outreach programme, particularly targeting under-represented groups.As I’m sure you’ll appreciate, outreach here is absolutely vital. Public engagement and science communication should be central to our mission.Coming from a non-science background, I can sympathise with how science can seem mystifying to some, and recent years have shown the dangers of science misinformation.But all of us again must ensure that people understand fusion energy, its risks and of course, its opportunities.And after all, it is up to us to inspire and nurture the next generation of passionate fusion scientists, engineers, and communicators.But we cannot do this alone. Fusion is a global endeavour, and the realisation of fusion energy requires continued collaboration.This evening I have met of course Brits, but Americans and even some Canadians and others – we need to collaborate, both to accelerate commercialisation and  to reduce the cost of fusion energy development.Our Fusion Futures Programme aims to strengthen existing international collaborations, as well as exploring new opportunities to contribute globally.And of course, the US will be one of our most important allies in all of this – our countries continue to lead the world in scientific research, and are home to the majority of the world’s top 10 universities, including this hallowed institution.That is why in November, we launched a strategic partnership with the US to accelerate fusion energy demonstration and commercialisation.This new partnership builds on longstanding collaboration between our research institutions and private sectors and aims to deepen our commitment to working together to solve these difficult challenges.Through it, we want to advance collaborative efforts on technical challenges, supply chain building, skills development, and public engagement.Let me just conclude by saying that I’m sure there’s no doubt amongst us that the world needs fusion now more than ever.And it is only going to be through this collaboration that we realise the perpetual human dream of unlimited, clean energy for all.It is a huge priority on both sides of the Atlantic and, of course, for the world.Thank you so much.",Conservative
Stuart Andrew,2024 Speech at the Women & Girls in Sport Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2024-speech-at-the-women-girls-in-sport-conference/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Minister for Sport on 20 February 2024.Thank you for inviting me here today, it is fantastic to see so many people here today who have a passion for women’s sport.I want to take this opportunity to tell you about the work the Government has been doing to ensure that women’s sport continues to thrive and to reiterate our commitment to supporting women’s sport at every opportunity – pushing for greater participation, employment, commercial opportunities, and visibility in the media.The Lionesses’ success at the EUROs helped make 2022 a landmark year for women’s sport, with the country winning its first major football trophy since 1966.Their journey to the final of the UEFA World Cup in 2023 continued to ignite unprecedented interest in the women’s game.This has clearly inspired many women and girls to take up the sport. The proof is in the stats – recent BBC analysis shows that there are now twice as many registered female football teams in England as there were just seven years ago.In September 2022, we commissioned Karen Carney to lead the Independent Review of Women’s Football.The Review, published in July 2023, was brave and unapologetic in its demand for change.It identified ten strategic recommendations that should be implemented to help create a sustainable future for women’s football.Our response, published at the end of 2023, sets out the Government’s continued support for the delivery of these recommendations.We see this as an opportunity to transform women’s football into a world-leading sport that not only creates significant economic and social benefits, but also raises the minimum standards for women’s sports on an international scale.To ensure momentum and delivery remains a priority, the Government will be convening an implementation group with all stakeholders responsible for delivering recommendations within the Review.The first meeting is scheduled for March 2024 and will ensure mutual accountability amongst stakeholders.The ambition has always been for the Review’s recommendations to go beyond women’s football and to apply to women’s sport more broadly.With this in mind, and following the recommendation in the Review, the Government will be convening a Board of Women’s Sports with industry leaders, academics and National Governing Bodies.This group will connect leaders from across women’s sports – building a shared vision to support women and girls in sport and looking at existing and future opportunities to help women’s sport continue to grow.Women’s sport will be a highlight at the Olympic and Paralympic events in Paris this year.Paris 2024 will be the first Olympics in history to achieve numerical gender parity on the field of play, with the same number of female and male athletes participating in the largest sporting event in the world.To help increase the visibility of women’s sport we will continue to support and champion the UK’s hosting of major women’s sporting events.The UK has an excellent international reputation in hosting major sporting events – with these events delivering benefits for the whole country.Future events include both the 2025 Rugby World Cup and the 2026 T20 World Cup, which I am pleased to say will both be held in England.This is all good news but we recognise that a number of challenges remain.Building a strong evidence base through data is a top priority for DCMS – helping to ensure the impact of sport and physical activity is articulated clearly so that we can see what interventions are needed to get specific groups active.The recent Active Lives Children and Young People Survey tells us that boys are more likely to be active than girls.Women in Sport’s latest impact report shows that girls as young as five years old don’t feel they belong in sport and that 1.3 million girls who used to love sport disengage as teenagers.Statistics like these are precisely why tackling disparities in participation levels is such a key part of our sport strategy, to ensure there is an inclusive offer for all.Published in August last year, our sport strategy – Get Active, sets out the long-term strategic policy direction for the sector. Our aim is to see 1.25 million more active women in England by 2030.Our focus is on establishing a lifetime of engagement with sport, supporting the sector to be welcoming to all, and ensuring the sector is prepared for future challenges and opportunities.This includes our ambition to provide the infrastructure and conditions needed to get as many women and girls involved in sport.As part of the sport strategy, we also launched the National Physical Activity Taskforce. The Taskforce connects government departments with the sector and independent experts, to focus on measurable actions that will get an additional 3.5 million people active.The Taskforce will ensure that we continue to tackle disparities in participation levels by promoting women’s and disability sport; by championing diversity; and by focussing on helping those who have the most to gain from getting active.And there are a number of initiatives which are encouraging more women and girls to be active, such as Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign.The campaign aims to eliminate fear of judgement. Sport England’s latest data shows that just over 3 million women said they increased their sport and physical activity levels as a result of the campaign. In addition, almost 1.5 million women say they started or restarted physical activity.Sport England have also developed the Studio You PE teaching resource which aims to get young girls engaged in PE lessons. The platform offers video-based lessons covering a range of non-traditional activities, like boxing, dance, pilates and yoga.In order to allow more women and girls to access more opportunities to be active, we are also investing over £600 million in school sport across the next two academic years.This investment will help deliver girls’ equal access to opportunities to play sport and do physical activity.We are also investing over £320 million into grassroots football and multi-sport facilities across the UK by 2025.  This will further support women and girls to get active. And all projects in England need to have a clear women and girls plan to receive funding.And we’ve committed to go further still. In November last year, the Government announced it is investing £25 million alongside £5 million from the English Football Association, to create a new Lionesses Futures Fund.This fund is expected to deliver up to 30 state-of-the-art 3G artificial grass pitches across England, providing gold-standard provision for women and girls, with reserved peak-time slots, women and girls only evenings and priority bookings for female teams.It is vital that everyone participating in sport feels safe and secure and that where allegations of inappropriate or harmful behaviour are made, these are taken seriously.UK Sport, Sport England and the Government have already taken significant steps to improve safeguarding in sport, including the revision of standards and protections for children in sport, the piloting of an independent complaints and disclosure system for elite sport, and the strengthening of positions of trust legislation.We welcome the recent announcement by UK Sport and Sport England to improve safeguarding in sport, following on from the recommendations of the Whyte Review into gymnastics.We will continue working alongside the sport and physical activity sector to identify the most pressing integrity challenges and potential improvements, including how processes around complaint handling and dispute resolution can be strengthened.We ran a call for evidence last autumn as a vital first step in this process. We wanted to hear how the current systems for handling concerns in sport work, and how these could be strengthened.We hope to publish the results of this exercise soon.We also know that one area that is attracting a lot of debate at the moment is the issue of transgender participation in sport.We want to ensure that everybody in this country has the opportunity to play and enjoy sport.Where sex does have an impact on the fairness of competitive women’s sport, domestic governing bodies and international federations must provide clear direction to protect the integrity of women’s sport.A way forward is needed that protects and shows compassion to all athletes, whilst being clear that the integrity of competition must be maintained.I will continue to engage with sports on this issue to understand what work national governing bodies are doing to protect women’s sport.In terms of media coverage, it is fantastic to see elite women’s sport getting better coverage. Recent data published by the Women’s Sport Trust shows that major international women’s sporting events, such as the Football World Cup and the Solheim Cup, as well as women’s cricket and rugby are continuing to drive record-breaking audience figures.In terms of investment, I am delighted to see that we are continuing to see record deals struck.The Department for Business and Trade has launched a Women’s Sport Investment Accelerator scheme. The scheme is providing a series of sessions offering market insights, connections and networking events alongside comprehensive mentoring for rights holders who are looking for investment.However, we know there is more to do to drive up audience figures and to build the case for further investment in women’s sport.Turning to governance, I am pleased that the strengthened Code for Sports Governance requires National Governing Bodies in receipt of significant public funding to agree a detailed and ambitious diversity and inclusion action plan with Sport England and UK Sport.Perhaps most importantly though, as Minister for Sport and Equalities, I am committed to creating an environment where women and girls feel safe and encouraged to be involved in sport in any capacity.I am hugely concerned about the effect that targeted online abuse can have on women and girls in sport.No-one should work in an environment where this behaviour is accepted, everyone should be treated with the respect they deserve.I want to take this opportunity to reassure you that we, as Government, take this behaviour very seriously. And I am personally committed to doing all I can to stamp out discrimination of any kind in sport.In conclusion, it is our ambition to increase participation, visibility and investment in women’s sport as highlighted in our strategy.These three interconnected areas together will help to create system-wide change.As I mentioned at my recent Select Committee appearance, I also want to take this opportunity to pay thanks to the heroes up and down the UK – the women and girls who volunteer day in, day out to help their communities engage in sport and physical activity.Not only do they contribute massively to sport, but they also help target important wider issues such as loneliness. Thank you to you all.I look forward to continuing to work with you all to ensure that all aspects of women’s sport continue to flourish.",Conservative
Andrew Mitchell,2024 Speech on UK-Nepal Development Portfolio and Funding,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/andrew-mitchell-2024-speech-on-uk-nepal-development-portfolio-and-funding/,"The speech made by Andrew Mitchell, the Development Minister, in Nepal on 20 February 2024.Distinguished guests, honourable Finance Minister Mahat, friends, and colleagues. Namaste.It is wonderful to be in Nepal again. I know we have just celebrated an important milestone: 100 years of our Nepal-Britain Treaty of Friendship.But the truth is we go back much further. Bonds forged on the battlefields with the Gurkhas – who are so rightly famed for their extraordinary courage – date back 2 centuries. Those admirable soldiers epitomise the deep and lasting friendship between the UK and Nepal. A friendship that continues to evolve and shape our future together.When I last visited Nepal, over a decade ago, you were still recovering after a decade of civil war. Today, we are witnessing the fruits of progress. 92% of people have access to electricity from 67% in 2011. Literacy rates have jumped from 66% to 76%. Infant mortality is nearly one third of what it was 25 years ago. You have made huge strides in economic growth.Your constitution enshrines important rights and addresses inequalities. Millions are engaging in the new democratic system. Not just at home but abroad, Nepal is also showing it is a model citizen – whether defending the UN Charter on Ukraine or as a peacekeeping superpower.Progress has been remarkable. But Nepal still faces challenges. We need to work together to solve them together.This is why, I will today set out how the UK is re-shaping our development approach focusing on 8 programmes that aim to deliver over £400 million in grant support to Nepal by the end of the decade.In December, I set out a clear UK vision for development that will help us – together – get our sustainable development goals back on track.Nepal is delivering great things. The UK is proud to support its initiatives including on Green Resilient and Inclusive Development.And I’ve seen how the UK-Nepal partnership is evolving. I’ve met members of a Dalit community in Karnali who are better able to grow crops thanks to UK-backed climate-resilient irrigation. I met dedicated professionals at Butwal hospital helping end preventable deaths.The UK’s new development approach focuses on Nepali leadership and systems, on mobilising money, on opportunities for all, and on securing a future for young Nepalis – a future in Nepal.This portfolio is not just about ‘good projects delivering great things’ – although that is what they will do! It is a joined-up, coherent approach, based on strong evidence, and focused on strong outcomes. Spanning economic transformation, climate resilience, stronger social services, inclusion and much more besides.How will we do this?First. We will work with government to unlock money for Nepal to mobilise funding for development and growth – which in turn will generate further investment.The private sector is central to this work. There is no doubt in my mind that the private sector is the engine, not the enemy, of development. The private sector creates jobs, puts food on the table, turbocharges growth and enables societies to thrive on their own terms.We’re committed to expand this and support the government’s investment summit – though I stress how vital it is that investors have the right environment. For example, legal reforms and ensuring all actions needed to avoid the Financial Action Task Force grey-list.We aim to mobilise private capital – helping government remove barriers to attract investors, supporting the sort of excellent engagement Minister Mahat had with the City of London last year. Helping develop a Sovereign Credit rating, helping Green Bonds, helping Investment Board Nepal get the best deals. With the Asian Development Bank, it will help Nepal access climate finance and work with the World Bank and others to help the country deal with the threats of climate change.Developing the economy will also help to create productive, attractive jobs such as those, Upaya – the delivery company – is creating with UK support. And I am looking forward to meeting young innovators who, with UK support, are using technology to identify climate risks.Second. Our new portfolio will help tackle the climate change crisis and deliver economic transformation.Yesterday I flew over the Himalayas and saw first-hand the beauty and the fragility of glaciers that took thousands of years to form but are melting 3 times faster than elsewhere. Our work with Nepal will help to protect the most vulnerable here, and beyond, recognising the Hindu Kush Himalaya supports a quarter of the world’s population. We will not sit back when reports suggest 80% of the ice here could be gone by the end of the century.Yesterday I also saw how British International Investment is helping Nepal realise some of its immense potential in green energy, at Upper Trishuli Hydropower Plant. Our new development portfolio will further support Nepal to access private and UN climate finance for projects like this and wider adaptation. It will help Nepal to plan for risk – like developing early warning systems through our RAIN programme.Our third offer focuses on women and girls: I’ve always said that to understand development, you need see the world through the eyes of women and girls.Later today I will have the pleasure of meeting inspiring Nepali women leaders, entrepreneurs and activists who spoke about their passions and ambitions. Increasing opportunities for women – which starts by ensuring every girl has a chance at a decent education – is not only the right thing to do but the smart thing to do. The most successful societies are the most inclusive; built around equality of opportunity for all.Finally, we will harness innovation and new technologies. Research, digital,AIand data will underpin what we do and how we deliver.I want to conclude by assuring you that my visit is just part of the UK’s lasting, and sustained engagement with Nepal.We have a tremendous chance now to galvanise the private sectors work in Nepal, and Britain will be your friend at your side throughout this process. Because the conflicts that damaged Nepal in the past are in the past, of the brilliance of your visit to the city of London last year, because of the focus and evidence what the private sector can be here.And because of the fact thatBIIis investing here on the ground now and will be a leader for so many others, now is the time through the use of private sector, the ability of the private sector to deliver huge amounts of investment, huge numbers of jobs, and huge amounts of tax which is so important to any government.Now is the time on the back of the Investment Summit that you are holding at the end of April, that we can see real progress made with the laws that are going through your Cabinet and your Parliament are clearly set in action, put in place, to assuring the private sector that here is a welcoming environment in which they can pride and prosper.You are, and remain, our uniquely close and valued partner. Today, I have outlined how that partnership will respond to the opportunities and the challenges we share, as we enter a new century of friendship. And today I salute that friendship and say, here’s to the next 100 years of working together.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2024 Speech to the NFU Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-speech-to-the-nfu-annual-conference/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, on 20 February 2024.I know, Minette, this is your last conference as NFU President – so I actually wanted to start by first paying a brief tribute to you.During a momentous period, you’ve been a formidable champion of our farmers – always fair, always thoughtful, and always forceful. If you asked some of my ministers down they’d probably say very forceful.But I know everyone will want to join me in once again paying a special tribute and a thanks to Minette for everything she’s done.Nine years ago, I gave my maiden speech in the House of Commons.I pledged that day to be a champion of agriculture, the countryside and all of my hard-working rural constituents.It’s farmers who feed us.Farmers who embody those British values of strength, resilience, warmth and independence.I see that in North Yorkshire – and across the country – week in and week out.I’ve been to the auction marts.I’ve walked the fields up and down Swaledale and Wensleydale.Enjoyed our high-quality British meat – which let me tell you we’ll continue supporting people to eat.I’ve visited upland farms, hill farms, arable and livestock farms.I even tried my hand at milking once – not very successfully I must say.But I see first hand the long hours that you work, the weather that you contend with, the family businesses you support, the communities you build……the beautiful countryside, the pastures, the hedgerows, the fields, that would not be the same without you.You do it not for praise, or high reward……but to put food on our tables……to maintain a tradition and a way of life…… and to steward our landscape.It’s part of who we are.And we don’t celebrate you enough.And so, on behalf of the nation, I just wanted to say: thank you.Biggest change in a generationNow while the importance of farmers will never change – farming is going through its biggest change in a generation.And as you do so, this government will be by your side.You’ve been dealing with soaring global prices in things like fuel and fertiliser.So we’ve been working hard to get inflation down – from 11% last year to 4% now.And we’re increasing payments in our farming schemes by an average of 10 per cent.You’re dealing with climate change and extreme weather too.Devastating flooding has damaged crops……delayed planting…… and has taken a huge toll on our farming communities.That’s why we quickly set out our flooding support…… and why we’re going faster than almost anyone else in the world to tackle climate change, even as we reduce the burdens on families.You’re also at the forefront of innovation – from gene editing to boost resilience to disease, to automation to harvest crops.And while thanks to you we enjoy good quality food all year round…… global events – including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – have put food security back at the top of the agenda.We’ll never take our food security for granted.We’ve got a plan to support British farming – and we’re going further again, today, in three specific areas.First, we’re investing in farming.We promised that across this parliament, every penny of the £2.4 billion annual farming budget would be spent on you.And we will absolutely meet that promise.I know that the transition from the Common Agricultural Policy has been frustrating.It’s taken time.And I appreciate the perception that we didn’t always get the balance exactly right.But I still believe the vision is the right one.CAP disproportionately rewarded the largest landowners and held back smaller farmers.It did little for food productivity or the environment.It was far, far too bureaucratic.Just remember – we used to argue about whether a cauliflower and a cabbage were the same crop…… and you could be fined thousands for a gateway being too wide, or a buffer strip too narrow.So it’s right that our new system invests in the foundations of food security – from healthy soils to clean water.[Please note: Political content redacted here]And today we want to go further to support you.So we’re announcing new steps to make our support schemes more generous and easier to use.Take the Management Payment.It’s working, with many farmers – small farmers especially – signing up.So I can announce today that we’re going to double that payment to £2,000…… with thousands of farmers receiving that money this Spring.We’re also launching the biggest ever package of grants this year…… to boost productivity and resilience, which will total £220 million.Increasing the Improving Farming Productivity scheme to invest in things like robotics and barn-top solar.We’re opening a new round of the Farming Equipment and Technology fund too, worth £70m.Second, as farming changes, how we work with you in government must change too.The services we provide must be shaped around your needs.And we’ve got to build a culture that’s based on trust.As President Eisenhower said: “You know, farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil, and you’re a thousand miles from a corn field.”So we’re changing the culture.That means trust, support, co-operation…It means delivering on our promise to cut planning red tape that’s stopping you from diversifying.In April, for instance, we’ll lay legislation so you can create bigger farm shops or outdoor sports venues.And it means more funding for grassroots mental health support……because we know what a tough job farming is.Thirdly, we’re strengthening support for your primary role……to produce the nation’s food.Food security is a vital part of our national security.And recent years have brought home the truth of that.Putin set off not just an energy price bomb……but a food price bomb, too.And as Minette has so powerfully reminded us time after time……in an age of climate change and instability……global food production will become increasingly volatile……so it’s important to strengthen food security here at home.Our Agriculture Act introduced a three-yearly report to monitor food security.But given how much has happened in the last three years, it’s clear that we need to go further.So today, I can announce we’ll step up our monitoring with a new annual Food Security Index, which we expect to be UK-wide.And yes Minette, we’ll make this statutory when parliamentary time allows.We’ll publish the first draft at the Farm to Fork Summit this spring.And I’m also delighted to say those Summits will become an annual event.One way to improve food security is to stop millions of tonnes of good, fresh farm food from going to waste…… just because of its shape or size.So we’ll also provide funding today, £15m, to redirect that surplus into the hands of those who need it.ConclusionSo in conclusion, supporting farmers, changing our approach, and strengthening food security – that’s our plan.And you can trust us to deliver – because… we already are.You said you wanted a fair price for your products……tomorrow we’re laying new regulations for the dairy sector, and we’re launching a review of the poultry sector.You asked for fair treatment in our trade deals……so we’re standing up for our farmers in those negotiations – whether it’s with Canada or anybody else.You asked for a fairer, more supportive regulatory system…… and we’ve reformed our approach, cutting penalties for minor issues, already down by 40%.But more than this, you can trust us because I know how important my neighbours, our farmers, all of you, truly are.You help support millions of jobs……add billions to our economy…… shape the landscape…… but most of all, you produce the food we need –…food that is some of the best and highest quality anywhere in the world.And that’s why I say to all of you and to Britain’s farmers…… just as I did in my first days in Parliament:I’ve got your back.Thank you very much.",Conservative
James Cleverly,2024 Speech at the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners General Meeting,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/james-cleverly-2024-speech-at-the-association-of-police-and-crime-commissioners-general-meeting/,"The speech made by James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, in the House of Commons on 7 February 2024.Thank you. I’m trying to work out whether the applause is for my attendance or for the announcement of the money.First of all, thank you all. It’s great to have the opportunity to speak to you all. I hope that those who know me, and some of you who have known me for quite some time, will have explained my credentials to those who’ve been maybe not known me for quite so long. I’m a big fan of the police and crime commissioner model. I was an advocate for it before it was cool. Back before it was legislation, and of course, I’ve come from my own background in police governance from the time that I was at City Hall in London.You are the voice of the local communities. When it comes to the governance of policing laws with our policing model, being of the community, for community from the community, having that golden thread of community accountability to the police forces that serve them, I think is incredibly important. And I also think it’s important that we maintain this pattern of dialogue, and that not only do I get to speak and you get to listen, which is of course always my favourite model of communication, but you also get to speak and I promise that I will listen.So the situation we find ourselves in the headlines can sometimes give the impression that we’re in uniquely dark and difficult times. But when we compare the situation with the end of September 2023, to the year ending December 2019, as we look back over those couple of years, we each have seen some really positive figures.So for example, hospital admissions, following an assault with a sharp object, which is the most objective measure of youth knife crime and violence, was down by 25%. And these are not figures you can fudge. That’s real. Homicides are down by 16%, neighbourhood crime down by 24%, 35% (fall) in domestic burglary, and an 18% fall in victim related crime. This is stuff that people in communities feel. This is what has an impact upon them. And those figures are heading in the right direction. But we will recognise that if you personally are a victim of crime, speaking about a general reduction is no solace, and that’s why it is so important that we cannot ever lose sight of the importance of the individual, of the victim, when we talk about those overall numbers.And I’m absolutely clear that the job of the Home Secretary, the job of the Home Office, I suspect, you will, at least in part agree with me on this, is about reassurance as well as the practicalities. It is really important that we ensure not only that people are safe, but that they also feel safe. Because, and I mentioned this, I think in the very first speech that I made as Home Secretary, because when people feel safe, they go out, they engage in their local communities, they volunteer, they live a fuller life than they would otherwise do. So of course trying to create an effect on people’s lives, but the fear of crime also has a corrosive effect. It limits people’s opportunity to live the best life they can lead.And that’s why I want to be able to look into the eyes of people around the country wherever they may be and know that they are feeling safe. I said so at the National Policing Board that I chaired recently, and this of course means as well as driving down those figures, it is about visible policing – and it is about the policing of visible crime crimes.High harm crimes are of course also incredibly important, but the public are also concerned about things like shoplifting. And sadly, in conversations I’ve had with members my own family and my friends, it’s still the case that far, far too many women and girls do not feel safe when they are out in the public domain and in a society such as ours, a modern society, that is unacceptable, and we absolutely have to prioritise the work that we do to address that.So I want to see major improvements in the quality of investigations. It’s a core function of policing. Because again, we know the far too many people report that the information that they provide to the police does not in their mind get appropriately acted on. So a key aim for this year for me is to increase the percentage of reported crimes that result in a successful outcome, because sadly on average only 8% of victim-based crime in England and Wales results in a successful outcome. Sadly, this has declined, and there is much, much, more to learn. And there is variation of course between forces, and fixing this I believe very strongly, more than anything else is central to build the general confidence of the public in policing.And so, back to basics is a bit of a cliché phrase from politicians. So, this is about going back to the core functions. Core policing, that core investigatory set of skills. Of course, that can be amplified, accelerated and supported with the use of cutting-edge technology, like retrospective and indeed live facial recognition software, which in the trials that I’ve seen the results of this had a dramatic effect, and we need to make sure all forces are operating at their full potential.And one of the reasons why I want to strengthen the role of PCCs, is that you, with your closest relationships and your intimate knowledge of the forces that you’re responsible for, are best placed at a local level, to drive forward a focus on that core policing functionality. And I know that you want to see increased safety and confidence in our neighbourhoods just as much as I do. This is, I don’t believe, me pushing you to do anything you don’t naturally want to do. And so we are looking for alliances and to get a commitment not just from the political level but of course from all the Chief Constables around the country to ensure that they pursue every reasonable line of enquiry, they attend home burglaries, they deliver on the commitments made by the Retail Crime Action Plan, all these things will be important steps in the right direction.And when I discussed this at the recent National Policing Board just last week, what I got was very, very supportive and very, very committed responses and it was great to hear that the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police was able to run through a list of results, which was in large part driven by that commitment to core policing. So I’m more confident than ever this is actually the right approach. And it’s also what the people we serve expect of us, it is what they want us to focus on. And so, in terms of tackling things like car theft, home theft, criminal damage, shoplifting, we do need to make sure we stay focused on the this and of course, the invisible crimes, those high harm crimes, are absolutely key, but those visible crimes – we must not lose sight of the impact they have on communities.When I first spoke my first public utterances as Home Secretary, I think of saying there is no such thing as minor crime – it’s a phrase that I despise and I think that implying that somehow there’s criminality which the police take less seriously or we take less seriously is something that we should avoid in all circumstances, for the reasons I said about the criminal behaviour that people see and feel most acutely in their communities.Now, I mentioned about the commitment I feel, particularly for women and girls, and it is incredibly important that alongside the tackling of that visible crime, that we dramatically improve the victims experience of the justice system for women and girls. You will be well aware of course of Operation Soteria, which is now being implemented in all 43 police forces in England and Wales. Government is ensuring that 2000 officers receive specialist training on the investigation of rape by April this year.And our actions are about supporting the actions you’re taking locally. To help improve the way that teams operate, are treated and to ensure that more rapists are arrested, prosecuted and put behind bars. His Majesty’s Inspectorate has found sadly victims are not regularly updated during the investigation at certain important points. And of course, this must change. The Victims’ Code of Practice will outline the minimum levels of support a victim of crime should expect from a local force and from their local Crown Prosecution Service. But that is a floor not a ceiling. That is the minimum, not what we should be aiming for.So everything that we do hinges on the broader confidence of the British public in the whole criminal justice system, and I’ve made the point that whilst the headline figures have come now, sadly, public confidence has not gone up. Part of that reason is because of a number of high profile and terrible failures in professional conduct by police officers, and for every headline grabbing incident, sadly, there are a number of others, less public, less high profile (incidents) where conduct has fallen short of what we expect. And inevitably, this has shaken, and certainly in some instances, shattered public confidence in policing.Again, I said when I was appointed that I will always seek to praise publicly, the people that keep us safe. But part of that contract is that I expect leaders in policing to do the right thing and demonstrate a commitment to reform – a deep seated commitment to reform and a complete commitment to professional standards.And that is why the government is giving police leaders enhanced tools, enhanced powers, but also an enhanced expectation that they do the right thing and lead their forces robustly. Once again, you as a group of people have a pivotal role in ensuring that police leaders hold their officers to account and that they in turn are held to account if they fail to do so. Just last week the families of Barnaby Webber, Grace O’Malley Kumar and Ian Coates visited the Prime Minister and had the chance to meet with him, and they raised serious questions about the events leading up to the tragic killings of their loved ones. It’s actually the right place to share that the Nottinghamshire police have referred themselves to the IOPC and I pay tribute to Caroline, the Nottinghamshire PCC, for commissioning a comprehensive College of Policing review into what happened.We have to be willing to learn painful lessons when situations like this occur. Part one of the Angiolini Inquiry is expected to report in the coming months and policing must absolutely take into consideration its findings, just as I will. I think I mentioned this again when I first spoke to you just up the road in my first week on the job, that one of the first roles I performed in the London Assembly whilst I was a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority as it was then, was on the professional standards committee. So I know first-hand just how critical it is to remove from the force those police officers whose integrity and behaviour are unacceptable.And I am still to this day committed that those unfit to wear the uniform must be removed, but that those who have proven to be innocent need to be swiftly exonerated. The government is delivering changes to the misconduct, vetting and performance system. So we’re helping police leaders grip this issue, giving them more control to act over those who fail vetting or fall short of requirements of required standards. And we know that in this room, that there are a group of people who are probably more angry about bad coppers than almost anybody else, outside those in uniform themselves, and equally I would suggest the only people perhaps who are more angry about bad coppers are good coppers. So we have to support the good coppers in doing the right thing. And that’s why we agreed to fund the development. We’ve agreed to fund the development of the system for policing, which provides forces with a timely alerting solution, so they can act speedily on any concerning intelligence about officers or police staff.And as I said, critical to public confidence is people seeing the police and seeing crime being dealt with; improving the visibility of police in a very targeted way, to deter criminals and ensure that communities feel confident. So I’m grateful to everyone who’s contributed to the autumn 2023 returns on visibility and especially to the APCC for coordinating the contributions. I wouldn’t say to the police chief, I expect them to give me hard evidence that they are prioritising the neighbourhood policing that is demanded of them.So with regard to hotspots and hotspot policing, I promised I would listen to you. We published an ambitious anti-social behaviour action plan in March 2023. The government pilot of antisocial behaviour hotspot responses has been, I’m pleased to say, a success, with additional patrolling, delivering on those promised outcomes. We’ve also provided GRIP funding to police forces in areas with the highest levels of serious violence. But coming back to the PCCs and given the overlap between ASB [antisocial behaviour] hotspots activity, and the GRIP serious violence fund, we will combine the 2 funding streams for a wider rollout to territorial forces across England and Wales in 2024 to 2025. In total funding available will be over £66 million, and each PCC area will receive at least £1 million each.Now, of course, I am sure that you will have been lobbied by your police officers, you will be lobbying me no doubt, about the police funding settlement in 2024 to 2025. We’ve listened to the forces about financial demands they face and giving police the resources they need to protect the public is of course a priority for us. And that’s why for the coming settlements for 2024 to 2025, the money available to PCCs will increase by up to £922.2 million, and there’s been an increase in the total settlement the more than 30% in cash terms since 2019 to 2020. And of course that is to support the uplift in police numbers.So having delivered a way to recruit 20,000 police officers: thank you very much for that. I look forward to working with you and your chief constables to ensure that those numbers are maintained. There are now 149,000 officers in England and Wales, higher than the pre-uplift peak of 2010. And of course the funding is there to stay, to maintain those office numbers, to ensure that they are on the beat, to ensure that they are supported.Finally, I wanted to say something directed towards you as a cohort, as well as the police forces that you work with. I said I’m a big fan of PCCs, of the PCC model, and I want to support you in that role. And as we discussed when I first stood up, I’m very much aware that you are increasingly visible high-profile individuals. And that is why I’m very, very happy to give additional money to help support your personal security, and to protect you in the role that you do. The security minister is continuing to work on cross government work to protect the security of all elected officials, including yourselves, and I’m very grateful for Katy Bourne who gave the APCCs engagement on this. I really hope it does make a difference; that additional million pounds of support is something that matters. I know it matters to you. And it matters because I want to protect your role and to protect you as individuals.So let’s continue working together. Let’s continue serving the people who elect us. Let’s make sure that we focus resources on the things that people care most about. And let’s ensure that when we look back on this forthcoming year, not only do we see an ongoing reduction in crime, we see an increase in the confidence of policing the country.Thank you very much.",Conservative
Stephen Flynn,2024 Speech on Ceasefire Vote Controversy in the House of Commons,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stephen-flynn-2024-speech-on-ceasefire-vote-controversy-in-the-house-of-commons/,"The speech made by Stephen Flynn, the SNP MP for Aberdeen South and the party leader, in the House of Commons on 22 February 2024.Last evening, we saw the best of this House in its ability to debate, and we also saw the worst of this House as it descended into farce. I think I speak for everyone in the Chamber now, and yesterday, when I express my deep sorrow that that was able to happen, given the content of what we were debating.Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, it descended into farce because of a decision that you—and you alone—made to ignore the advice that was given to you by the Clerks. In doing so, on the Opposition day of the Scottish National party, my colleagues and I were denied the ability to vote on a matter which is of grave concern to us, and which, over recent months, we have sought to raise in this Chamber at every available opportunity. It ultimately turned into a Labour Opposition day. That, quite frankly, is not acceptable. As I have expressed to you privately, prior to today’s proceedings, we do not, on these Benches, believe that you can continue in your role as Speaker. We do not have confidence in your ability to do so. I would therefore welcome clarity, either from you or the Leader of the House, about how we can best facilitate the earliest possible vote in this Chamber to that effect.",Other

I reiterate that I made a judgment call that did not end up in the position where I expected it to. I regret it and I apologise to the SNP—[Interruption.] Just bear with me. I apologise to the House. I made a mistake: we do make mistakes and I own up to mine. We can have an SO24 to get an immediate debate because the debate is so important to the House.I will defend every Member in this House. Every Member matters to me in this House. As has been said, I never, ever want to go through a situation where I pick up a phone to find a friend, on whatever side, has been murdered by a terrorist. I also do not want another attack on this House—I was in the Chair on that day. I have seen, I have witnessed. I will not share the details, but the details of the things that have been brought to me are absolutely frightening for all Members of the House, on all sides. I have a duty of care and I say that. If my mistake is looking after Members, I am guilty. I am guilty because—[Interruption.]—I have a duty of care that I will carry out to protect people; it is the protection that led me to make a wrong decision. With the risk being put on all Members at the moment, I had serious meetings yesterday with the police on these issues and on threats to politicians as we head towards an election. I do not want anything to happen again.Yes, I will apologise, as I always will when I make a mistake as I did. I offer an SO24—that is within my gift and power—but I will also do whatever it is to protect anybody in this Chamber or anybody who works in this House. That is my duty of care.",Labour
Owen Thompson,2024 Speech on the Gaza Vote in the House of Commons,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/owen-thompson-2024-speech-on-the-gaza-vote-in-the-house-of-commons/,"The speech made by Owen Thompson, the SNP MP for Midlothian, in the House of Commons on 22 February 2024.Yesterday was incredibly disappointing, from our point of view. It was meant to be an Opposition day, and it was one of only three times in a calendar year when our party gets an opportunity to put forward its business to the House. I do not think that what we came forward with was a surprise to anyone. We were allocated an Opposition day four or five weeks ago, but totally understandably, it had to be moved when the Northern Ireland Assembly was reconvening. At that stage, there were conversations, and I was asked when people would have sight of the Gaza motion that we would bring forward, so it is quite extraordinary for anyone to suggest that they did not know we might come forward with a motion on that topic. When it got to our Opposition day—one of the very few times when we can put forward our policies—our voice was silenced: our motion could not be voted on. That is incredibly disappointing for me and a significant number of my constituents, and those of my hon. Friends and hon. Members from across the Chamber who wanted to support the motion.Given that, in effect, we did not get an Opposition day yesterday, can we be allocated an alternative date? As others have said, we lost a significant amount of time at the start of the debate, and because of the Speaker’s decision, unfortunately we lost 40 minutes at the end of the debate. That meant that colleagues were cut short, and some withdrew from the debate. What consideration will the Leader of the House give to that suggestion—and, beyond that, to protection for the smaller parties, so that they are not simply railroaded for the political purposes of either of the bigger parties?I echo the comments of the shadow Leader of the House, but it is critical that all Members of this place, whatever their position or status, be protected from bullying and intimidation. If reports from many media outlets are to be believed, it is entirely unacceptable that significant pressure was put on Mr Speaker to come to his decision yesterday. What steps will the Leader of the House take to investigate those very serious claims? If there is any substance to them, it is an affront to democracy that a party leader can direct decisions of the Chair of this place.As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am, as Chief Whip, involved in a number of conversations on how business comes forward. I had direct assurances that I would have a vote on the words of my motion yesterday. Everyone knew well in advance what the potential outcome would be at the end of yesterday’s debate, so to suggest that no one knew is utter nonsense. The reason we are in this position is that convention and the Standing Orders of this House were overruled, against the advice of the Clerks. That only happened because the Labour party wanted to be dug out of a hole. That is unacceptable.",Other
Liz Twist,2024 Speech on the Inter Faith Network Closure,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/liz-twist-2024-speech-on-the-inter-faith-network-closure/,"The speech made by Liz Twist, the Shadow Levelling Up Minister, in the House of Commons on 22 February 2024.I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms) for securing the urgent question.Inter-faith and multi-faith dialogue are absolutely essential components of society, not only to resolve differences but to build strong and collaborative communities that are able to come together in times of need. Given recent events—the war and violence in Gaza—that is more important than ever. As I am sure the whole House recognises, the Government have a special responsibility to facilitate positive relationships between different faith communities, and although I appreciate that the Minister has now given some explanation of why they have chosen to withdraw funding for the IFN, outstanding questions remain.Let me ask the Minister some straightforward questions. When was the decision to withdraw funding from the network made? What impact assessment was made, and what discussions were had about the vital need to continue to promote understanding about and between different faith groups, and to encourage co-operation? When was the Inter Faith Network notified of the decision? Does the Minister have plans to increase support for other groups to make up for any loss of provision arising from this decision?Every Department will inevitably monitor and review the grants that they award, but the House should expect that to be done in the spirit of due process. As politicians, we have a responsibility to bring communities together. At a time when divisions are being exposed, I hope that the Minister can assure the House that the Government remain committed to inter-faith and multi-faith dialogue.Felicity BuchanI thank the hon. Member for her comments. Again, I stress the importance of inter-faith work. I see it in my own constituency; it is very important. The Government are already supporting other institutions that do such work.The hon. Member asked specifically for timelines. The Secretary of State wrote to the IFN on 19 January saying that he was “minded to withdraw” the offer of funding in light of what we have discussed. He invited the Inter Faith Network to make representations to him on this matter, and he received its response on 22 January. After careful consideration of those representations, he confirmed that he wishes to withdraw the offer of funding to the Inter Faith Network for the reasons that we have discussed. He wrote to the co-chairs on 21 February to inform them of his decision. I stress again that the Department has been very clear that the Inter Faith Network should have been developing other sustainable sources of funding.",Labour
Felicity Buchan,2024 Statement on the Inter Faith Network Closure,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/felicity-buchan-2024-statement-on-the-inter-faith-network-closure/,"The statement made by Felicity Buchan, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, in the House of Commons on 22 February 2024.May I thank the right hon. Gentleman for raising the issue of the Inter Faith Network? I am grateful for all his work as chair of the all-party group on faith and society and as a long-standing advocate for dialogue across faiths.As the Under-Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset (Simon Hoare) said during an Adjournment debate in January, we know full well the role that faith communities play in our society. We are extremely supportive of efforts by faith groups and others to bring together people of different faiths and beliefs.The Secretary of State wrote to the co-chairs of the Inter Faith Network on 19 January this year to inform them that he was minded to withdraw the offer of funding for the 2023-24 financial year. This was because of the appointment of a member of the Muslim Council of Britain to the board of trustees of the IFN. As the House will be aware, successive Governments have had a long-standing policy of non-engagement with the MCB. The appointment of an MCB member to the core governance structure of a Government-funded organisation therefore poses a reputational risk to the Government.The Secretary of State invited the IFN to make representations on this matter, which it subsequently did. He carefully considered the points raised by the IFN before concluding that its points were outweighed by the need to maintain the Government’s policy of non-engagement with the MCB, and the risk of compromising the credibility and effectiveness of that policy. Inter-faith work is valuable, but that does not require us to use taxpayers’ money in a way that legitimises the influence of organisations such as the MCB.The Department regularly reminds our partners, including the IFN, of the importance of developing sustainable funding arrangements rather than relying on taxpayers’ money, which can never be guaranteed. The potential closure of the organisation is therefore a matter for the IFN, as an independent charity, and not the Government. The Government continue to be fully supportive of developing and maintaining strong relationships across faiths and beliefs.Sir Stephen Timms (East Ham) (Lab)Since 1987, the Inter Faith Network has been the UK’s principal vehicle for inter-faith dialogue, supporting the annual Inter Faith Week, and activities and dialogue undertaken by inter-faith groups across the whole country. The network has been supported by Government funding for some 20 years. The IFN was told on 31 March last year, before the trustee appointment that the Minister referred to, that its funding would be ended from the following day. Why has the organisation been treated in that extraordinary way? Last July, the network received a letter from the Secretary of State to inform it that it would, after all, receive funding for the current financial year. That promise has never been honoured. Why not?Given the debate in this Chamber yesterday, is it not extraordinarily stupid to be shutting down at this precise point our principal vehicle in the UK for Muslim-Jewish dialogue? Surely we need more, not to be shutting it down? Why has the Secretary of State not honoured the commitment that he made to me to meet me, the right hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) and the noble Lord Singh to discuss this matter before making his decision, and will the Minister pay tribute and express thanks to the trustees and officers of the Inter Faith Network for the very important contribution that they have made to UK national life over the last 37 years?Felicity BuchanI truly believe that inter-faith work makes a good contribution to our society. My constituency is one of the most diverse in the entire country, and I have on a number of occasions brought together my mosque, my synagogue, Christian churches and my gurdwara. We recognise the benefits of inter-faith activity. I thank the Inter Faith Network for its work; however, we have always been clear with that organisation and any other organisation or charity that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities funds that they need to put in place alternative sources of funding. As I said, the Government cannot fund this organisation when a trustee is part of the MCB.Theresa Villiers (Chipping Barnet) (Con)I was contacted last year by my constituent Esmond Rosen of the Barnet Multi Faith Forum, who expressed concern about the imminent withdrawal of funding from the IFN. As we have heard, it looked in July as if the problem was resolved—at least for the financial year—so it is regrettable that we are in this position. I completely understand the importance of not engaging with organisations that have hard-line views, but surely we can find some compromise to keep the IFN in business, because it does incredibly valuable work to foster respect and mutual understanding between different faith groups.Felicity BuchanI thank my right hon. Friend for all her work on inter-faith matters. What has changed since July is the appointment in November of a trustee who is a member of the MCB. In terms of inter-faith work, there are so many examples of positive, thriving initiatives across the country that are bringing people together. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities funds a number of those partners, including Near Neighbours and Strengthening Faith Institutions, which organise local-level inter-faith events to foster community cohesion.",Conservative
Kevin Hollinrake,2024 Statement on the Post Office Horizon Scandal,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/kevin-hollinrake-2024-statement-on-the-post-office-horizon-scandal/,"The statement made by Kevin Hollinrake, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business and Trade, on 22 February 2024.As a Back Bencher, I first spoke on the matter of compensation for victims in March 2020, which is obviously long after the right hon. Gentleman first campaigned for it. I pay tribute to his campaigning on this subject, which remains undiminished. My appetite for compensation for postmasters is equally undiminished, although I accept the need to increase the pace of delivery.As of this month, £160 million has been paid in financial redress to more than 2,700 victims affected by the Horizon scandal. More than 78% of eligible full claims received have been settled as follows: 102 convictions have been overturned, and 42 full claims have been submitted, of which 32 have been settled; 2,793 applications to the Horizon shortfall scheme have been received, and 2,197 have been settled; 58 full claims have been submitted to the group litigation order scheme, and 41 have been settled.Our top priority remains ensuring that victims can access swift and fair compensation. We have introduced optional fixed-sum awards of £600,000 for victims with overturned convictions and of £75,000 for group litigation order members as a swift means of settlement, and 100% of original applicants to the Horizon shortfall scheme have received offers of compensation. Today we are discussing what other measures can be taken to speed up compensation with the Horizon compensation advisory board, on which the right hon. Gentleman sits.Since the Prime Minister’s announcement on 10 January, officials in the Department for Business and Trade and the Ministry of Justice have been working at pace to progress legislation for overturning convictions related to the Post Office’s prosecutorial behaviour and Horizon evidence. I will provide a further update to the House very soon.Mr JonesThank you, Mr Speaker, for granting the urgent question. I draw the attention of the House to my interest as a member of the Horizon compensation advisory board.I like the Minister. He campaigned on this issue before he was a Minister, and he has been a very good Minister, but a lot of that good work was undone on Monday by the performance of the Secretary of State for Business and Trade. I am disappointed that he has not taken the opportunity today to talk about the overturned convictions. I understand that later today, at 12 o’clock, there will be a written ministerial statement on the subject. I do not think that is the way to do it, as the House needs an opportunity to discuss the overturned convictions.I will ask the Minister a few questions. It is quite clear now that Nick Read, the Post Office chief executive, wrote to the Lord Chancellor basically opposing the overturning of all convictions, saying that up to 300 people were “guilty”. It is not yet clear who instructed him to do that. On Monday, the Secretary of State said it was done off his own bat. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on that.If there are to be overturned convictions, they cannot just be about Horizon; they should also be about Capture. Evidence that I have put to the public inquiry and sent to the Minister yesterday clearly indicates that the scandal predates Horizon. Those affected need to be included in both the compensation scheme and among those with overturned convictions.The board is meeting this afternoon, and we have made recommendations to the Minister on how to simplify and speed up the compensation scheme. Will he give an assurance to the House that once the recommendations are agreed, we can announce them quite quickly, primarily to restore to the sub-postmasters some faith, which was wrecked by the performance of the Secretary of State on Monday?If the Minister’s written ministerial statement at 12 o’clock is about overturning convictions, will he give a commitment to come back to the House on Monday to give an oral statement, so that the House can interrogate him and discuss that issue?Kevin HollinrakeI thank the right hon. Gentleman for his question. The overturned convictions are a key priority for me and my Department. I am always keen to update the House whenever I can. There always has to be a sequence to ensure that we follow proper process. What we are doing potentially affects the devolved Administrations, so it is really important that we engage with them properly. That is one of the reasons why we need to make the written statement later today. I have never been unwilling to come before the House and report on what we are doing. I will, of course, continue to do that.On the letter from the chief executive to the Justice Secretary, I am aware of the allegations by Mr Staunton. They are very serious allegations that should not be made lightly or be based on a vague recollection. If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the letter from the former permanent secretary, it is clear that she believes the allegations are incorrect, and that there was never any conversation along the lines referred to by Mr Staunton. I think it is pretty clear that those allegations are false.The right hon. Gentleman has regularly brought up Capture. We are keen to continue to engage with him on that to ensure that those affected are included in any compensation where detriment has occurred. I note his point about an oral statement. As I say, I am always keen to give such statements whenever possible, and to be interrogated on our plans. I do not think he will be disappointed by what we announce later today.Paul Scully (Sutton and Cheam) (Con)Now that the then permanent secretary has outlined that she did not implicitly or explicitly tell the then chairman of the Post Office to slow down compensation, I hope we can spend time less time talking about someone who has lost his job and more time talking about postmasters who have lost everything. Will the Minister, who is doing great work in sorting this out, recommit to August as his target date for getting compensation—life-changing compensation—out of the door as soon as possible?Kevin HollinrakeI thank my hon. Friend for his work on this matter; as my predecessor, he did a tremendous job. The most concerning allegation we heard over the weekend was about the delay in the payment of compensation. In her letter, which is publicly available, the permanent secretary wrote:“It is not true that I made any instruction, either explicitly or implicitly. In fact, no mention of delaying compensation appears in either note.”So I agree with my hon. Friend that we should move on from that and focus on what really matters, which is getting what he rightly described as life-changing compensation to postmasters as quickly as possible. That is his, and will remain our, No. 1 priority.",Conservative
Lucy Frazer,2024 Speech at the Ad Association LEAD Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/lucy-frazer-2024-speech-at-the-ad-association-lead-conference/,"The speech made by Lucy Frazer, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on 8 February 2024.Good morning everyone. I want to start by recognising the significant role that you, and your sector, play in our economy and there couldn’t be a better forum for that message.The Advertising Association, IPA and ISBA – are among the strongest voices for the ad industry in the UK and each body is recognised for being an effective champion for all of our brilliant media agencies, brands and creatives.And it’s a pertinent week for this Conference. Because on the other side of the Atlantic, they are gearing up for one of – if not the – most important days in the advertising calendar. The Super Bowl.Despite all that has changed with the revolution in what we watch…when we watch…and where we watch TV – this sporting moment has retained its place at the pinnacle of advertising.With a TV audience over 100 million, the pressure to deliver compelling material is overwhelming.Last year alone, the cost for a 30 second slot was $7 million.But what stands out is not the cost, it’s the quality. And the adverts have become part of the event and part of the spectacle.Ahead of today’s event I was reflecting on what makes advertising so important.The first thing that comes to mind is the creativity that you see every day expressed through advertising – and how that creativity is the basis for one of the most successful industries in the country.But more than that, the success of these industries actually provides: cheaper newspapers and magazines for readers to enjoy; your favourite hits on commercial radio; the ability to watch Coronation Street for free; and seeing the entire industry of podcasts setting up from nothing a few years ago and entertaining, informing and challenging us today.None of these would be free or available at affordable prices without the work you do with adverts.Advertising is an essential cog in the free market.And on top of that, you arm people with the information they need to make decisions about what to buy.I recognise – and this Government recognises – what your industry does for our economy.Our Creative Industries are growing at twice the rate of the rest of our economy and last year accounted for £126 billion.And advertising is a massive part of that success story. It already accounts for around 15% of Creative Industries output and all indicators suggest it will continue to grow in size.Last year alone, Ad Association figures show the UK ad market is estimated to have grown by 6% to reach £37 billion.This growth and value is a credit to the way our companies have become magnets for the best ingenuity, the best creativity and the best talent.Today, in 2024, there are very few places in the world that can rival our status as a global hub for the industry.I’m proud to be the Secretary of State responsible for the advertising industry. It’s undeniably a world-class sector.But I believe we’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible.When I became Culture Secretary, I made it one of my first priorities to maximise the potential of our Creative Industries.And I want advertising to help lead that charge.Last year I set out a Creative Industries Vision to deliver £50bn of extra economic growth, 1 million extra jobs and a pipeline of talent for 2030.This will only be possible with Government and industry working together and with a shared purpose.It’s a blueprint that is packed with measures, from investment in R&D to support for businesses scaling up across the country.And a major part of it is a focus on skills.If we want our advertising industry to thrive in the future, we need the right skills for the right jobs.Advertising has long been an incubator for creative skills and where some of our great artists got their break.…before Salman Rushdie wrote Midnight’s Children, he worked at Ogilvy and came up with slogans like ‘Irresistibubble’ for Aero.…Jonathan Glazer – the English director of the haunting new portrayal of Auschwitz, The Zone of Interest – started off as a filmmaker for brands like Stella Artois and Volkswagen.All incredible talents. All artists who originally found expression in advertising.So through our Creative Industries Vision we’re working closely with the Department for Education on a Cultural Education Plan.The aim of which will be to give our children greater access to culture and art at school age.This week is also National Apprenticeships Week.Like you, I’m determined to increase take-up of apprenticeships in advertising and marketing sectors.And that’s why in July I co-chaired, with the Education Secretary, a roundtable exploring solutions to apprenticeship challenges and how we can make sure they are flexible and work in the interests of companies in sectors like advertising.We’re also working closely with the Advertising Association and The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising on the Creative Careers Programme.That programme will help encourage 11 to 18 year olds to pursue creative careers through events, panel talks and filmed content with industry leaders, and I know that the Ad Unlocked section of the programme reached around 2,500 students from 100 schools during Discover Week 2023The programme will help highlight the range of skills that are relevant to professions like advertising in the future.Because as we see skills in data and Artificial Intelligence are becoming more and more relevant.And of course we must all recognise the impact of AI.I know that, in the same way that advertising was one of the first industries to use machine learning and algorithms for more effective analytics and customer targeting advertising is already leading the way in applying AI to different parts of its day-to-day work.From more conventional uses like making ads easier to generate and track…Or writing marketing emails with subject lines and delivery times tailored to specific subscribers.To less conventional uses like Heinz giving fans of its Ketchup bottle a chance to see it redesigned in an infinite range of styles, from impressionism to a stained glass Ketchup window. Or a recent campaign from Virgin Voyages that allowed users to prompt a digital avatar of Jennifer Lopez to issue customised video invitations to a cruise.We are seeing companies across this sector beginning to innovate, experiment and embrace AI. To use AI in a positive way, and one that customises the experience for audiences.WPP’s chief executive, Mark Read, said recently that AI will be as transformative as the internet was 30 years ago. He’s right.And as the world’s largest advertising group, WPP has been at the forefront of investments in AI and is a company that clearly recognises that this technology should be a creativity-enhancing tool.As a government, we want to harness the benefits of AI – right across society – to spur productivity and growth.And I see no reason why it cannot be a force for good for UK advertising.Advertising agencies have an enviable record of growing in response to technological shifts, not shrinking.But we are also clear that AI – which relies purely on data – cannot replicate the creativity that can only come from a human being.We are looking closely at how to ensure creators have the control and transparency they need over their content when it is used by AI models.And we are committed to ensuring that AI is used responsibly.To that end, the Advertising Standards Authority recently published their 5 year strategy for AI-Assisted collective ad regulation.This strategy sets out how they will use their new AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system to identify and swiftly act against irresponsible online ads.But there is work to do, across all sectors, to understand the risks associated with AI – as well as the benefits.I want to finish by touching on our online advertising programme.As many of you will know, tackling online harm has been a key focus for this government and this includes harms associated with advertising.When we published the response to our consultation on the Online Advertising Programme in July, we set out a plan to build a regulatory framework that would be agile and fit for purpose.And this included a targeted focus on tackling illegal advertising, and increasing protections for under-18s against adverts for products and services that are illegal to be sold to them.We’re committed to doing this and there will be legislation when Parliamentary time allows.Ahead of that though, we’ll be publishing a further consultation on the details.And we will look carefully at the interaction with the Online Safety Act, and its fraudulent advertising duty which captures the largest online platforms and search services.At the same time, under the leadership of people like the co-Chair, Mark Lund, the Online Advertising Taskforce is driving forward actions to raise standards.And we continue to encourage industry to work closely with the Advertising Standards Authority, including on its principles for intermediaries and platforms.I know this is something many of you have been involved in and that there’s collaboration across the Advertising Association, IAB UK, IPA & ISBA to address illegal advertising and improve the overall advertising landscape.I’d like to finish by thanking you all again for the generous invitation to this important event and for your engagement with my department.You’ve got a packed agenda and one that reflects the fact that advertising has arguably never been more influential than it is today.I want to continue working with you in a way that is strategic and forward thinking.And in a way that maximises the true potential of your businesses, your agencies and your brands.So thank you again, and I look forward to continuing our work with all of you in the future.",Conservative
Wayne David,2024 Speech on Freedom and Democracy in Iran,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/wayne-david-2024-speech-on-freedom-and-democracy-in-iran/,"The speech made by Wayne David, the Labour MP for Caerphilly, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I commend the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) for introducing this debate and the Backbench Business Committee for allowing the time for it.This debate is important and timely. Although we have had only a few contributions, they have been significant and important. The hon. Member mentioned the Ashraf 3 camp in Albania, and although it is not entirely clear what has happened there it is important to note his point that the Inter-Parliamentary Union, for which I am on the executive of the British group, will be sending a delegation to Albania. I will make a point of making sure, as best I can, that the delegation raises the matter in its visit.At the start of my contribution, I make the point that the authoritarian and theocratic regime in Iran presents and presides over a reprehensible repressive state. As has been said, there is little real democracy in today’s Iran. At the beginning of March, there will be elections to the Iranian Parliament and the Assembly of Experts. As has been the case in the past, the Council of Guardians will prevent candidates standing whom the Supreme Leader does not approve. We expect that those who are blocked will be moderate and reforming candidates.The elections will rightly attract a great deal of attention, not least because they are the first to be held since the widespread protests in Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. As I am sure many Members are aware, her death in September 2022 occurred in police custody after she had been arrested for not complying with strict Islamic dress code. Following her death, there were widespread protests across Iran for a number of months. They were cruelly repressed by the regime, but it is important to remember and to pay tribute to the many thousands of women and girls who were brave enough to take part. Indeed, I was proud to speak in an event in this House organised by the Azadi Network. Speakers were from all parties in this House, and they demonstrated a real solidarity, which all parties have clearly expressed, and I stress that that is so important. It was the House of Commons saying to the Iranian people, “We are with you.”The protests were subject to appalling brutality in Iran, meted out by the Iranian authorities. It is estimated that at least 20,000 people were detained, including many children. It is estimated, too, that more than 500 people were killed, and many more were seriously injured. The violence did not stop with the end of the demonstrations: there have been many allegations of torture and appalling treatment of detainees, including reports of sexual and gender-based violence against women, men and children.As has been said, Amnesty International has reported that Iranian security forces are guilty of using the most terrible sexual violence against people who are merely peaceful protesters. It is important to note the comments made by the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), who spoke eloquently about the lack of human rights and pointed out the lack of religious freedom in today’s Iran.If the Iranian regime is repressive at home, it is guilty of aggression abroad. In fact, it is among the world’s foremost state sponsors of terrorism. Iran, through its so-called proxies, is guilty of helping to initiate violence across much of the middle east. Iran has supplied huge support to Hamas in Gaza. It has supplied and supported Hezbollah in Lebanon and is still doing so. In Iraq—including in Kurdistan—and in Syria, Iranian sponsored militants have attacked US forces. On Sunday, an Iran-backed group was responsible for a drone attack on a US military base in Jordan that resulted in the death of three American soldiers and the injury of many other people.As we all know, the Houthis, who again are closely linked to the Iranian regime, have been conducting missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red sea. Of course, the US and the UK have been undertaking surgical strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, and Labour is on record as supporting that proportionate action. Further afield, the Iranian regime has developed close links with Russia and has supplied a large number of drones that are being used in Ukraine, so there can be absolutely no doubt about the Iranian regime’s malign influence across the middle east and the world.On Tuesday, I raised Iran’s destructive activities across the globe with the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell), at FCDO questions. He indicated that the Foreign Secretary was in the region that day and holding meetings on the very issue. He also said that the Government were“working extensively with Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, Saudi Arabia and America.”—[Official Report, 30 January 2024; Vol. 744, c. 710.]I would be appreciative if the Minister indicated in his reply how those meetings went and how the ongoing discussions will proceed on this important issue.We are aware that Iran is active in this country. As a number of hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Harrow East, said, the head of MI5 has previously referred to potential threats by Iran to kidnap or kill British or UK-based people. In 2015, the police discovered an Iranian-linked bomb factory in London. Since the beginning of 2022, Iranians have been responsible for at least 15 potential threats against British or UK-based individuals. That was recognised by a number of hon. Members in the Chamber.Earlier this week, The Times reported that a number of members of the Iranian diaspora who have spoken out against the Iranian regime have been warned by counter-terrorism police that they face an increased threat. It is also important to note that the Iranian authorities have been systematically targeting BBC Persian staff, intimidating their families in Iran as well as intimidating staff in this country. Since the protests in Iran in 2022, the BBC security team has reported that the risks to BBC Persian staff have “increased”. Because of those very real threats, I believe that the sanctions introduced, and the further ones announced, should be welcomed. I hope, however, that the Government will closely examine other ways in which pressure can be brought to bear on the appalling Iranian regime.One additional measure ought to be the total proscription of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. I understand that there is ongoing debate in Government about this, but if they do not bring forward appropriate measures that would lead to a total ban of the IRGC in this country, Labour will do so if it forms a Government. If the Government do that now, Labour will support it. I hope that the Government will respond in a truly positive way.This has been an important debate with excellent contributions. This issue should unite all of us who believe strongly in democracy, freedom and human rights in this country and throughout the world.",Labour
Martyn Day,2024 Speech on Freedom and Democracy in Iran,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/martyn-day-2024-speech-on-freedom-and-democracy-in-iran/,"The speech made by Martyn Day, the SNP MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I am grateful to the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) for securing this debate. The issue of freedom and democracy in Iran is a very important one, and I find myself commending him for his speech and agreeing with every point he made.As we have heard, the issue is really about a lack of democracy and a lack of freedom. Elections will of course be held on 1 March to Iran’s Parliament, but they can in no way can be considered free, fair or credible. It is more of a selection than an election, with the unelected, 12-strong Guardian Council having the power to approve candidates. With a track record of banning moderates and reformers from standing, it is no surprise that many candidates have already been disqualified. This body can also veto laws made by the Parliament.My litmus test for fair, free and credible democratic elections is: can any individual freely stand for election, can anyone vote in secret for any individual who is standing and can the sovereignty of the people be exercised by their representatives? Clearly, Iran fails on all those counts. The reality is that Iran is ruled as a totalitarian theocracy: it is not a democracy. Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the unelected institutions under his control.Corruption persists across all levels, with powerful actors such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps operating beyond scrutiny. Media and civil society face restrictions hindering their role as independent watchdogs for ensuring transparency and accountability. The regime, as we have heard, is ruthlessly held in place by its intelligence and security force the IRGC and is supported by the wider apparatus of the state, including the judiciary, the Ministry of Intelligence, the police and others.Iranian authorities have extensively used Iran’s repressive machinery to censor discussion of these issues and persecute women, human rights defenders and anti-death penalty activists. Political activists who support democratic change have been particularly vulnerable to detention and death over many years, despite which the organised resistance, the People’s Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran—or MEK—have remained determined to establish a free democratic and secular republic, and I wish them every success with that struggle.The level of oppression and human rights abuses by the current regime in Iran is truly appalling and is getting worse. According to Freedom House, Iran has decreased its total global freedom status from a derisory 14 out of 100 in 2022 to 12 out of 100 last year. Freedom House gave Iran zero scores for most areas of fundamental rights including: the individual right to practice or express religion, faith or non-belief in public and private; free and independent media; the Government operating with openness and transparency; safeguards against corruption; the question of whether the freely elected head of Government and national legislative representatives determine the policies of the Government; and fair and free elections.The UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed alarm at“the disproportionate number of executions of members of minority communities, in particular the Baluch and Kurdish minorities”,and I share this concern. Last year, at least 864 people were executed, the highest figure since 2017. Any use of the death penalty is unacceptable to me and I believe this substantial increase reflects the regime’s inability to suppress the protests that have arisen.Women lack equality and face discrimination in both law and practice. Examples include a woman’s testimony in court being given half the weight of a man’s and unequal compensation for victims’ families. Women also face disparities in inheritance rights. The regime fails to protect women and children from sex trafficking while Iranians and migrant workers, especially from Afghanistan, are subject to forced labour and debt bondage.The reality is that some 88 million Iranians are effectively living in what is a state prison, otherwise known as the Islamic Republic of Iran. But it does not have to be that way and I applaud the courage and determination of those who have stood up to the regime and protested for the rights that we take for granted, and have done so at great risk to themselves.The ongoing uprising began in September 2022 with the arrest of a Kurdish Iranian girl in Tehran by the Tehran morality police for not veiling, after which she was brutally beaten, fell into a coma and tragically lost her life while in custody. That brutal killing of Mahsa Amini prompted widespread protests across Iran, with thousands of people demanding regime change for a secular democratic republic. The ongoing uprising has resulted in over 800 unlawful deaths, including of minors and women. Additionally, around 30,000 Iranians face cruel treatment in jails, including torture and sexual violence, highlighting the dire situation in Iran.Ultimately, Iran’s future must be decided by its own people, but given that they have virtually no avenues for reform, the people have no option but to resist, to demonstrate, to defend themselves, and to seek alternative forms of opposition. Iran has been witnessing a massive popular uprising—a call for freedom and democracy largely led by women and young people. I have heard it described by some as a revolution, and I hope it is a successful one. It has clearly rattled the Tehran regime and I believe this is partly behind the regime promoting and encouraging conflict outwith its borders as it seeks to dampen the momentum of the protests inside Iran while simultaneously rallying the regime’s own forces behind the Supreme Leader’s fundamentalist agenda.As we have heard, Iran is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism. This exporting of international terrorism by Iran cannot and will not be tolerated, nor should be its support for Russia in the war with Ukraine, use of cyber-attacks, or hostage-taking diplomacy, and I condemn the involvement of Iranian officials in the killing of US servicemen. According to reports in The Times on Tuesday this week:“Tehran has already been accused by MI5 and police of more than a dozen assassination and kidnap plots in Britain against dissidents and media organisations in the past two years. Officials have previously expressed fears that, emboldened by the situation in the Middle East, Iran could ramp up its activity in the UK and present a wider terror threat.”Although I welcome the recent announcement of additional sanctions on senior Iranian officials, I wonder why we are not taking an even stronger approach. At a minimum, we should urgently proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. I have lost count of the number of times that I and others have called for that action. Proscription would be a tangible step in the UK in the furtherance of freedom and democracy in Iran. We should also support calls for the UN to dispatch international observers to visit Iran’s prisons and to meet those detained by the regime. We should all support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people. I pay tribute to the work of the resistance units that emerged in late 2017 and have helped inspire Iranians to defy the prevailing tyranny.In conclusion, the SNP stands in full solidarity with Iranians journalists, women, men and young people calling for democratic change. The bravery of Iranian citizens standing up against brutality and dictatorship is beyond inspiring. I wish them every success in seeking a new democratic and secular republic in Iran. It will be better for them and the world when they succeed.",Other
Jim Shannon,2024 Speech on Freedom and Democracy in Iran,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/jim-shannon-2024-speech-on-freedom-and-democracy-in-iran/,"The speech made by Jim Shannon, the DUP MP for Strangford, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I congratulate the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) on setting the scene. His passion and interest in this subject is renowned. In my short time in the House, I cannot remember a time when he did not lead or sponsor such debates. It seems that for various reasons, others who wished to speak have not been able to. It is unfortunate that the input of others has been curtailed, but that does not lessen the importance of the issue that the hon. Gentleman has raised. When it comes to Iran, we in this place have spoken up on many occasions; indeed, we did so yesterday in the free Iran group with Maryam Rajavi. The hon. Member for Southend West (Anna Firth) was at that meeting, and led and chaired it for a short period of time.This is a big issue—a massive issue. I declare an interest as chair of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief, speaking up for those of Christian faith, those of other faiths and those of no faith. It is clear to me that that is not just about people’s right to express themselves religiously and the beliefs that they have, but about standing up for human rights. The issue of freedom and democracy in Iran, especially the freedom of religion or belief, continues to escalate—depressingly so. That is why this debate is so important. Violations of freedom of religion or belief happen frequently in Iran, and continue to escalate. The hon. Member for Harrow East is right to highlight the danger that Iran poses to peace in the middle east: it supplies the Houthis with aid and finance, supplies Hezbollah in Lebanon with finance and weapons, supplies Hamas in Gaza with aid, arms and finance, and supplies many terrorist groups in Syria in the same way. Of course, Iran also supplies drones to Russia to use against Ukraine, so it is an instigator of war and an opposer of peace in the middle east.As persecution and violations of religious freedom increase in frequency and impact, I and other members of the APPG have submitted several written questions to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. I am very pleased to see the Minister in his place, because he is always helpful in his responses. We have written to the FCDO with a large number of questions over a period of time, but unfortunately, responses have not been forthcoming. I ask the Minister to introduce some speed into the process, if possible, to secure an answer within the prescribed time: the FCDO said it would respond to our questions, and is duty bound to do so, but has not responded yet. The incidents we have highlighted and the FCDO’s response to them must be brought to Parliament’s attention, as well as the importance of developing better policies and sanctions against Iran for those actions and for its denial of freedoms and democracy.The one thing that has always bothered me when it comes to Iran is its violations against women and children. They have been attacked, brutalised, and scarred by acid attacks, they have no access to jobs, education or ownership of property, they do not have the right to marriage, and many other opportunities in society are denied them. Over Christmas, several Christians were arrested in Iran, with no response yet from the FCDO—again, we are waiting for a response. Iran finally released on temporary bail two journalists who covered the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, which led to the mass protests in 2022. We asked the FCDO whether the Minister would make an assessment of the implications of those releases for its policies, but as yet, there has been no response.Recently, the Iranian Government displaced Baha’i farmers by seizing farmland that they had been tending for several generations. The FCDO responded to my question on that topic by stating:“At the 78th UN General Assembly, we co-sponsored the Iran Human Rights Resolution, calling for Iran to eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination on the basis of thought, conscience, religion or belief. We are committed to promoting religious freedom and will continue to work with partners to advocate for the rights of the Baha’i community in Iran.”Such action is commendable and appreciated. What actions have been taken to help implement that resolution?Again, I ask these questions because I know the Minister will respond; I also look forward to the response of the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David), and of the SNP spokesperson, the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Martyn Day). The UK recently enacted new sanctions against Iranian individuals for human rights violations, including flogging as a punishment for exercising freedom of religion or belief. Roya Heshmati was flogged by police for not wearing a hijab in a picture posted on her social media— I have also posed a question to the FCDO on that topic. What sanctions have been imposed on those who inflict such persecution?Most importantly, potential violence and armed conflict with other countries may impact the rights of democracy and freedom, especially for religious minorities in Iran, so we must decide what policies are going to be enacted. Iranian-backed groups have attacked a US base in Jordan, and this brings about the increase of tensions between the west and Iran, despite Iran’s denial of its involvement in the attack—it got its proxies to carry out it out. As armed conflict and violence increase, the oppression of religious minorities increases tenfold. For someone to be a Shi’a, a Baha’i, a Christian or a member of an ethnic minority in Iran decreases their life expectancy.We must be ever mindful of the situation of religious minorities in Iran, but also of what the potential effect may be of UK actions against Iran through sanctions and changes in diplomatic relations. The hon. Member for Harrow East made a point about what we need to do and to do more of, and it is quite clear that the sanctions the Government are imposing are not effective. Because of that, we have to look at other methods, such as stronger sanctions or other ideas. Again, I would like to hear from the Minister, if possible, what thoughts he has about how we can hit Iran harder.Iran is continuing to arbitrarily detain human rights defender and 2023 Nobel peace prize recipient Narges Mohammadi, subjecting her to torture and other ill treatment by deliberately denying or severely delaying her access to adequate healthcare to coerce her into adhering to Iran’s abusive and degrading compulsory veiling laws. This places Narges Mohammadi’s health at great risk, particularly as she has serious heart and lung conditions. Jail is never good for someone’s health, and if they are in bad health, it is even worse.If Iran is willing to imprison and mistreat such an individual, what is to prevent it from doing so with ordinary individuals in Iran who have religious identities or beliefs different from those of the majority? Although we may not be able to force Iran to change its laws, we can place further requirements on their doing trade with the UK. When we look at trade last year, we see that the UK exported nearly £224 million of trade to Iran, and in return Iran sold back some £190 million. What regulations and policies are companies required to adhere to for such trade to occur? Are there any human rights and religious freedom requirements in place, or inspections of companies in Iran to ensure that they adhere to human rights working conditions and do not discriminate against religious minorities in hiring or in the workplace? These are the things I would like to see.I conclude with this: the need for Iran to raise its treatment of religious minorities and to provide citizens with democracy is becoming more and more necessary. That is why the hon. Gentleman’s debate today is so important, and we hope—we look to everyone for this, but ultimately to the Minister—that the response will be one that gives us heart. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I speak today on behalf of my brothers and sisters in the faith in Iran, who do not have the opportunity to worship their God as I do. It is for that reason that I thought I had to be here to speak for them.",Other
Bob Blackman,2024 Speech on Freedom and Democracy in Iran,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/bob-blackman-2024-speech-on-freedom-and-democracy-in-iran/,"The speech made by Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP for Harrow East, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I beg to move,That this House condemns unreservedly the actions of the government of Iran and the violent conduct of the police in suppressing protests in that country; is deeply concerned over Tehran’s growing use of terrorism, espionage, cyber attacks and hostage-taking diplomacy to restrict and eliminate the Iranian democratic opposition, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), targeting in particular members of the organised opposition, PMOI (MEK), in Ashraf 3, Albania and NCRI gatherings since 2018; notes that the resistance is struggling for the establishment of a secular democratic republic; calls on European governments, especially the government of Albania, to counter Tehran’s illegal activities and uphold the rights of members of the Iranian opposition PMOI (MEK) at Ashraf-3 in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, the European Convention of Human Rights and international law; is further concerned by reports of threats made to Iranian dissidents in the UK; urges the Government to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the list of proscribed terrorist organisations; and further calls upon the Government to work with international counterparts to ensure that further sanctions are placed on Iran without delay and Iran is held to account for its illegal activities at home and abroad.I thank the Speakers-collect and the Backbench Business Committee for the various arrangements that had to be made because of this afternoon’s emergency business.I am truly horrified by the current situation in Iran, which was sparked by the brutal murder of a young girl by the authorities while she was in police custody. Her crime—if we could call it a crime—was merely wearing her hijab in a manner that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps determined to be too loose. I thank Mr Speaker in particular for allowing me on a number of occasions to debate this issue in the House. However, I wish this debate had taken place under different circumstances and that by now our Government had taken decisive action to proscribe the IRGC in its entirety.The urgency for this charge is now more relevant than ever. Not only does the human rights situation in Iran remain dire, but the uncertainty around the middle east, which is spreading further afield at a rapid rate, is predominantly driven by the funding and support from this exceptionally threatening, conniving and deceitful regime.Anna Firth (Southend West) (Con)My hon. Friend is making an excellent speech. Does he agree that the Iranian people are locked in a vital struggle for justice, democracy and particularly equality, and that that struggle must go on until the oppression of women in Iran and the use of sexual violence as a means of doing so stop?Bob BlackmanI thank my hon. Friend—she must have looked at the next section of my speech. The IRGC literally runs and rules Iran, disregarding democracy, freedom of expression and basic human rights. The majority of people live in fear of speaking out or engaging in political matters in any form, with vigorous covert intelligence deployed to all parts of the country, seeking to sift out any potential opposition that might pose a threat to the regime.The authorities censor all media, jamming satellite TV channels and filtering and blocking social media platforms such as X, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Further, the authorities shut off or disrupt the internet and mobile phone networks, particularly during protests, in order to suppress mobilisation and hide from civilians the sheer scale of the violations and privacy breaches committed by the security forces. In attempting to justify the infringements, the IRGC is even trying to push an internet user protection Bill through the Parliament in Iran. That legislation would further erode online freedoms and people’s access to the global internet.All opposition in Iran, whether it is independent political parties, trade unions, striking workers, protesters, civil society organisations or simply truth-sharing journalists, is brutally suppressed. There has never been a clearer example of an undemocratic self-claimed democracy. Political opposition frequently receives the harshest treatment from the regime, and Iran is the country responsible for the second highest number of executions each year, behind only China. Whatever people’s views on capital punishment, it cannot be acceptable that that position persists.The House will no doubt recall the uprising that took place in September 2022, sparking nationwide protests that continue even today. I take this opportunity to honour the bravery of those people. It cannot be easy for anyone to stand up and speak for basic rights when there is a high likelihood that they or their family will be brutally targeted as a result. Following the riots, the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Javaid Rehman, raised the alarm about the concerning trend of arbitrary arrests, detentions and executions targeting individuals for merely exercising their freedom of expression.Ian Paisley (North Antrim) (DUP)The hon. Member is making a brilliant speech. The dead hand of Iran is, unfortunately, everywhere; its influence and impact is incredible, and I would suggest that it is even in this place. There is an all-party parliamentary group whose secretariat is BIRD—the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. That is led by a man, Sayed Al-Wadaei, who was outed as a front leader for the promotion of Iranian foreign policy. In 2012, a man called Saeed Al-Shehabi was exposed by the London Evening Standard as part of a terrorist group with links to Iran. That organisation and those people are part of a secretariat to an APPG here, and that needs to be exposed and Members need to take action.Bob BlackmanI thank the hon. Member for raising that point. That is now clearly on the record, and the House authorities will need to look at that particular issue.Recently released figures, which I am sure will have been generously tainted by the regime, show that 870 executions took place in 2023 alone. That is a 30% increase on the previous year, and many of those people were women and children. Tens of thousands of political prisoners, the overwhelming majority being peaceful, have been arrested in Iran—arrested for merely holding a sign or removing a headscarf. Once arrested, their treatment is utterly unfathomable. Amnesty International has recently reported that the atrocities such prisoners are subjected to include being beaten, raped, gang raped and psychologically abused; the list of horrors goes on. It is truly despicable, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southend West (Anna Firth) said.The plight of women remains intensely troubling. Women remain second-class citizens in Iran: they continue to receive intensified opposition from the regime; they face entrenched discrimination in both law and practice; and they are subject to domestic violence, child marriage, unequal divorce and custody rights, mandatory dress code, restricted nationality and travel rights, and unfair inheritance laws—to name but a few examples. Women in Iran have been jailed for merely singing in public or publishing their work on social media.Perhaps even more troublingly, Iran celebrates the greatest number of female executions, beating even China on that particular front. Armita Geravand was a 16-year-old schoolgirl, who was tragically killed through the brutality of the so-called Iranian morality police. Like Mahsa Amini, her only crime was refusing to wear her hijab. Sadly, such stories are not isolated in Iran, and I am sad to say that they will continue without significant intervention from international communities and the Iranian people.I am proud that in this House alone, we have an abundance of great women representing us; their contribution is vital and championed by us all. It is shocking that, in 2024, this is far from the case across many other parts of the globe.Anna FirthI am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way yet again. He is making an absolutely brilliant, first-class speech, and shining a light on the despicable, brutal regime in Iran. Does he agree that that brutal regime is literally on an execution spree at the moment, having executed more than 350 protesters and dissidents since the conflict in Gaza began? That is a rate of execution of not far off 100 protesters per month. Does he agree that it is long overdue that the UK and our partners demand that the UN Human Rights Council dispatch an international fact-finding mission to Iran to visit the regime’s prisoners—to meet political prisoners and detained protesters—so that, globally, we can finally shine a light on what is happening in Iran? And, of course, he is right that the IRGC should be proscribed.Bob BlackmanI thank my hon. Friend—that was almost a speech rather than an intervention!I have had the privilege on a number of occasions to visit Ashraf 3, which is home to some 2,700 Iranian refugees. The museum on the site exceptionally depicts the long struggle that people have endured, with brutal attacks and massacres occurring all too frequently. In Albania, the regime’s claws continue to menace the people. The IRGC has repeatedly targeted the Albanian Government through cyber-attacks, disinformation and terror attacks. I am saddened that, on occasion—most notably in June last year—the camp has been raided by the Albanian police forces. There have been reports of unjustified force and copious amounts of pepper spray being used. Unfortunately, one man died from the injuries that he suffered. I am almost certain that that attack was founded on false claims generated by the IRGC.The regime holds a power over Albania. Its continued attacks on cyber-systems are used as so-called warnings to the Government, blackmailing them with threats of continued attacks if they do not suppress the rights of camp members. I urge the Albanian Government to stand up to those threats. No country should infringe its morals for fear of such a corrupt and wicked enemy. This is a time for western allies to stick together and stand up to malicious terror acts. I am glad that our Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation will be going to Albania shortly, and I hope that they will raise this issue.The Albanian Prime Minister has said publicly that residents of Ashraf 3 should not engage in any political activity—even peaceful conversation. That is tantamount to denying the right to freedom of expression. I am saddened that that announcement came after a show of support for the camp by Albanian parliamentarians, showing that the dramatic shift in opinion must be down to the negotiations with the IRGC. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that he will offer support to our Albanian counterparts, encouraging them to stand up to the regime and protect the rights of those in that camp, who have already experienced too much brutality.This debate comes at a time when the world has never been so unsafe. We have a war raging in Europe, attacks by the Houthis in the Red sea, an illegal war in Gaza by the Hamas terror group, Hezbollah in Lebanon and war in Syria, as well as other dangerous militant groups. The one thing that links all those examples is the IRGC, which stands as the head of the snake, funding, training and supplying weaponry to all those organisations. Its outreach and capabilities are frankly frightening.The IRGC has been found to have supplied drones and weapons to Russia as Moscow and Tehran deepen their co-operation in a partnership that is likely to continue and intensify as they commonly seek to weaken the west. Furthermore, the IRGC provided significant direct funding and training to Hamas in the lead-up to the dreadful 7 October attacks. Most recently, the Houthis in Yemen have targeted shipping lanes in the Red sea. The Houthi militant group was set up by Iran and remains under its influence. Linked to those attacks, Iran announced that it had subsequently launched into low-earth orbit three satellites that the US believes can be used to more accurately target intercontinental ballistic missiles.The regime in Iran ignites a threat not only to the international community, but, perhaps most concerningly, to the domestic security of the UK. Individuals with Iranian links, or who have spoken out against the IRGC in this country, have frequently been targeted. Furthermore, MI5 announced last year that it had intercepted a significant number of Iran-backed terror attacks.Holly Lynch (Halifax) (Lab)The hon. Member is making an incredibly powerful speech, and I congratulate him on securing the debate. He is quite right: last year, we heard from the director general of MI5 and the head of counter-terrorism policing that they had intervened to disrupt up to 15 kidnapping and assassination attempts in the UK coming from Iran. That is why the argument for proscription is such a powerful one. It would not be merely symbolic; it would be about granting the security services and police forces in the UK additional powers to truly dismantle any foothold that the IRGC has in the UK that allows it to facilitate those assassination attempts, which we must close down. Does he agree that that is why proscription is so important?Bob BlackmanI thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. The position here is that the Iranian Government are funding professional gangs to inflict attacks and violence on individuals in this country. They have neither mercy nor morals in how far they will go. A Spanish politician and vocal opponent of the Iranian regime was shot outside his home by a criminal gang employed by the IRGC. We must not allow such despicable attacks to occur on domestic soil. It is completely unacceptable that people in this country are being followed home or having to suppress their freedom of expression for fear of being targeted. I urge the Government to tackle this issue with urgency.The Iranian authorities have been targeting BBC Persian staff, who are predominantly based in the UK, and their families since 2009 in an attempt to intimidate them into stopping their work as journalists. The intimidation escalated in 2017 and has been at an unprecedented level since September 2022. BBC Persian staff frequently receive credible death threats, threats of horrific violence, thousands of abusive comments and increased threats to their personal safety on online platforms.With several colleagues, I was a target of the Iranian regime when we attended the annual gathering of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, with delegations from almost every major democracy, back in 2016. An Iranian diplomat tried to bomb the conference. He had the audacity to smuggle the bomb through security in diplomatic bags. Thankfully, the Belgian and French authorities apprehended the terrorist and no one was harmed. Had he succeeded, there would have been a world war.The Iranians assumed responsibility, and they forced the Belgian authorities to hand over this despicable so-called diplomat after they kidnapped two Belgian journalists and held them as hostages. If this does not highlight to the Government that we cannot engage in dialogue with the Iranian regime, I do not know what will. The key point is that the current policy on Iran is not working. Its influence is stretching across the middle east and further. It is time to look for an alternative solution, and I urge the Government to proscribe this merciless regime with utmost priority.I am aware that we have already sanctioned individuals, but we must go further. Until we start cracking down on the IRGC, it will continue to extort and suppress innocent people. Its military capacity is growing and, even if it does not already possess a nuclear capability—I have my doubts—its nuclear capability will also grow.The international community must wake up and protect countries such as Israel by killing the initial piece of the chain. Without funding and support from Iran, terrorists like Hamas will not be able to carry out their dreadful attacks. Iran will feel the pinch only if there is full proscription, and I reiterate my plea for the Government to do so. Hezbollah is already proscribed, and it is the birthchild of the IRGC. The IRGC must therefore be proscribed, too.I have heard the rumours that the Government are holding off such action in order to continue a line of dialogue, but there is no honest or trustworthy dialogue to be had with this terrorist regime. Instead, we must show Iran that such action is not and will not be tolerated. Fifty per cent. of the IRGC’s training efforts are on indoctrination, creating more ruthless, more radical and more committed generations. The dangers are only increasing, so we must act before it is too late.It is high time that we work together to banish this unlawful regime, to protect innocent protestors and to champion free democratic rights across the world—we often take those rights for granted. To oppose the Iranian regime is no longer a political calculation but a simple humanitarian choice. We must support the Iranian people and acknowledge the legitimacy of the Iranian opposition if we are ever to see a free and democratic Iran.I look forward to hearing from colleagues on both sides of the House. I know that several Members who wanted to take part in this debate have unfortunately had to leave, but I hope we will have excellent replies from my hon. Friend the Minister and, indeed, the shadow Minister.",Conservative
Clive Betts,2024 Speech on Financial Distress in Local Authorities,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/clive-betts-2024-speech-on-financial-distress-in-local-authorities/,"The speech made by Clive Betts, the Chair of the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Select Committee, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.It is a great pleasure to make this statement on behalf of the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee about its report “Financial distress in local authorities”. Let me first thank the Leader of the House for tabling the business motion that has allowed the statement to be made. Our Committee Clerk is excited about the fact that we have apparently set a procedural precedent today; I was certainly not aware of that, but I am now. Let me also thank the Backbench Business Committee for originally providing the time for the statement.Our inquiry looked into the extent of the funding gap in local authorities’ finances, and some of the main spending challenges that they face: social care, special educational needs and homelessness. The report brings attention to key issues ahead of the upcoming local government financial settlement. It makes recommendations not only for urgent action to resolve the immediate crisis, but larger reforms for the Government to consider after the next election.Everyone recognises that the financial crisis in local authorities across England is out of control. In recent months an alarming number of them have issued section 114 notices—admissions that their spending is exceeding their income—thus effectively declaring bankruptcy. In the last six years, eight authorities have issued such notices; in the previous 18 years, none did. It is no longer the case that a small number of individual councils with particular issues are in financial distress. We are now seeing widespread financial distress across large parts of local government, and the situation is only getting worse. The Committee has heard evidence from the Local Government Association that one fifth of councils may be in financial distress within the next year.At the heart of this crisis is a multi-billion-pound funding gap. The income available to local authorities from council tax, retained business rates and government grants has not kept pace with the increased demand for their services and the effect of inflation. As a result, the Local Government Association estimates that authorities face a funding gap of £4 billion over the next two years to maintain services at their current levels.Witnesses have told us that the current funding system is “broken” and “not fit for purpose”. Successive Governments since 2010 have reduced the level of central Government grants awarded to local authorities by about 50%. This has been partly offset by a 20% increase in council tax, which has therefore led to an overall reduction in local authority core spending power of 26% in real terms between 2010 and 2021.In the short term, local authorities need immediate additional funding. Our report recommends that the Government must include additional funding in the local government finance settlement for 2024-25 to fill the gap. Last week the Government announced £600 million of extra funding, and I give credit to the Minister, who has been assiduous in listening to the views of Members on this subject. However, although those measures are welcome, they are not sufficient.Our report recognises that the Government have recently begun consultations on other methods of increasing the funds available to local authorities. We have cautiously welcomed the fact that they are considering giving authorities additional capital flexibilities to fund day-to-day costs, but we have recommended that those additional flexibilities should be considered carefully and limited to extending flexibilities over invest-to-save activity. We do not want to store up problems for future years.Our report also recommends other ways in which the Government can improve funding for local authorities in the medium term. We have repeated the recommendation, which our Committee first made in 2021, that the Government must urgently reform council tax. This would involve undertaking a revaluation of properties and introducing additional council tax bands. Finally, we have once again called for the Government to implement the business rates reset and fair funding review, to which they committed themselves in 2016 but which they have yet to deliver, and to reintroduce multi-year settlements.Our inquiry asked witnesses what had caused the sharp rise in council expenditures. It identified three particular areas where costs have risen significantly: adults’ and children’s social care, special educational needs, and homelessness. On adults’ social care, the increasingly complex needs of a changing population continue to drive up costs, and long-term workforce shortages and inflationary pressures have made the position worse. As the Committee recommended back in 2022, the Government need to recognise that local authorities will need several billion pounds of additional funding each year to continue to deliver and improve adult social care, and should plan a sustainable mechanism to deliver this funding that does not simply rely on increasing council tax.On children’s social care, our inquiry found that councils are facing rising demand for residential care placements and a poorly functioning market for providing them. That has driven significant cost increases. Our report recommends an urgent comprehensive reform of the children’s social care system. As part of that, the Government should help local authorities consider greater collaboration so that between them they can deliver more children’s care services directly, instead of through private suppliers. Our inquiry also found that local authorities face significant financial pressures in providing services for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities—SEND. The number of education, health and care plans has “skyrocketed” since they were introduced in 2014, which has significantly increased demand for more expensive forms of SEND provision and home-to-school transport. Funding is provided to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant, but it is not enough to meet the demand and does not cover home-to-school transport.The Government have already been forced to take temporary measures to prevent SEND costs from forcing a large number of councils into bankruptcy. In 2020, the Government introduced a “statutory override”, allowing local authorities to exclude any deficits on their DSG spending from their main revenue budgets. Local government faces a potential cliff edge of section 114 notices whenever the statutory override comes to an end. The question is: will the Treasury write off that extra borrowing when the time comes? Our report recommends, therefore, that in the short term the Government should provide additional funding for home-to-school transport. In the long term, there needs to be a fundamental reform of the EHCPs, based on a cross-Government review.Finally, our report makes it clear that rising homelessness has increased costs for councils. A big cause of the increase has been the Government’s decision to freeze local housing allowance rates in April 2020, so our report welcomes the Government’s recent announcement that they will increase local housing allowance rates from April 2024. However, it also raises concerns about the Government’s decision to then re-freeze the rates in 2026. Instead, we recommend that local housing allowance should be retained at at least the 30th percentile of local market rents. In the longer term, the best solution, as the Committee has recommended repeatedly, is to build more social housing, which will always be cheaper than paying for temporary accommodation.These problems require a long-term solution. That is why the Committee has made recommendations in this report for whichever Government are elected after the next election. The next Government, regardless of their political persuasion, must embark on a fundamental review of the systems of local authority funding and local taxation, both council tax and business rates. In doing so, they must be clear about what local authorities are for and how they can best co-ordinate with delivery of the Government’s wider objectives. We have recommended that the next Government should consider many options, which may include land value taxes and others, and wider fiscal devolution. They must also explore all options for reforming the funding and delivery of social care services, to address the underlying causes of the acute funding and delivery pressures currently faced by local authorities. It is my hope that the need we have identified for additional funding will be properly reflected in the local government financial settlement we will debate next week, and that our other recommendations will be carefully considered by this Government and whoever form the Government after the next election. I commend this report to the House.",Labour
Robin Millar,2024 Speech on the United Kingdom Internal Market,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robin-millar-2024-speech-on-the-united-kingdom-internal-market/,"The speech made byRobin Millar, the Conservative MP for Aberconwy, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.It is a privilege to speak in the debate and to follow the many hon. and right hon. Members who have spoken with great wisdom, knowledge and personal experience on these matters.It is informative to apply to article 6 of the Acts of Union the four tests for impact that were developed by Justice Colton—specifically, Northern Ireland’s compliance with certain EU standards; the bureaucracy and associated costs of complying with customs documentation and checks; the payment of tariffs for goods at risk; and the unfettered access enjoyed by Northern Ireland businesses to the EU single market. I question the representation of the Supreme Court judgment as set out in paragraph 14 of annex A to the Command Paper, but those were matters for the last debate, and there is not time to make my point.The Windsor framework removed many EU standards for GB-produced consumer goods destined for Northern Ireland. That does not change under the SI before us. The second test—on bureaucracy and compliance costs associated with customs—should concern us, as the protocol saw the diversion of £1.2 billion-worth of goods in supply chains from GB to the Republic. Indeed, logistics businesses testified to the Lords Windsor Framework Sub-Committee on the complexity of managing mixed loads, with two large haulage firms stating that groupage had been “forgotten” in the framework.Expert analysis has also suggested that 75% of output in non-exempted manufacturing sectors, including electronics, engineering and chemicals, comes from firms with turnover above £2 million, which will see their GB supply chains stuck in the red lane or diverted abroad. The Command Paper published yesterday contains a pledge—a UK internal market guarantee—that no more than 20% of goods will flow through the red lane. In practice, that creates a monitoring panel to report on any failures to hit the target and make recommendations to which the Government must respond. That is admirable but does not represent a material change to existing customs requirements under the protocol. It is also worth noting that, worryingly, that could be achieved simply by diverting supply chains away from GB towards the EU, as affected GB businesses cut Northern Ireland out of their distribution chains.The regulations before us create important easements for Northern Ireland to GB trade, including a guarantee that future divergence will not impact the ability of Northern Ireland traders to freely access GB markets. That is welcome, but the bulk of distribution has always pertained to GB-to-NI trade, not the reverse. As is also noted in the Command Paper, although technology may ease compliance costs in the medium to long-term, those costs will still exist. Shipping from London to Belfast will continue to require significantly more bureaucracy than shipping to York or Edinburgh. The third test, on tariffs, is not covered and does not apply.Finally, let me turn to Northern Ireland’s preferential access to the EU single market. I must emphasise that the clear trade-off that we have chosen to give Northern Ireland unregulated access to EU supply chains comes at the cost of complicating access to GB ones, despite the fact that Northern Ireland imports from GB are two and a half times those from the EU and six times those from Ireland. Whatever easements we offer, that has created a customs, judicial and legislative border across the kingdom, and it is hurting our businesses. The fact that Northern Ireland continues to have preferential access to the EU single market is unarguable, but it should not be misunderstood. Again, I find that final test informative.Nothing I say today is intended to diminish the achievement of the deal when it comes to material gain for Northern Ireland. Although I welcome the elements within the new deal, which undoubtedly offer increased safeguards for the Union, it does not change the fact of EU law’s application to Northern Ireland, additional bureaucracy for GB businesses attempting to access Northern Ireland, the existence of tariffs, or Northern Ireland’s de facto placement within the EU single market. Once again, the qualities and effectiveness of this deal will emerge over the months and years ahead, I am sure, and through the scrutiny that must come from this place. I will continue to offer my support in those months and years ahead.",Conservative
Theresa Villiers,2024 Speech on the United Kingdom Internal Market,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/theresa-villiers-2024-speech-on-the-united-kingdom-internal-market/,"The speech made by Theresa Villiers, the Conservative MP for Chipping Barnet, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.The important statutory instruments that we are discussing today are the latest in the process of implementing the result of the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union. They may not have attracted the same volume, attention or emotion as those endless meaningful votes in 2018 and 2019, but they are no less important. This has been a long and difficult process that has divided the nation, but the end goal of restoring our status as an independent, self-governing democracy has been a prize worth fighting for.For centuries, Members of this Parliament strived to ensure that we would be governed only by the laws made by our own elected representatives, and that is what Brexit seeks to deliver, but we all know that the job is not yet finished when it comes to Northern Ireland, so I pay tribute to the Secretary of State, the Minister and the DUP for their work and determination to tackle the problems with the Windsor framework and secure Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market. I very much welcome the advances being made towards the restoration of power sharing and devolved government, and I accept that the statutory instruments are an important part of enabling that to happen because of the significant changes they contain.Of course, I completely understand the DUP’s concerns regarding the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework. We must do all we can to minimise trade frictions between Britain and Northern Ireland. The agreement on the Windsor framework started that process—for example, by making the movement of medicines, food and items for retail sale much less problematic. I believe that further improvements will be delivered by the deal that we are looking at today, which will further reduce checks and inspections. My concern is that the central problem remains that Northern Ireland is subject to single market rules without having a vote on them. The instruments we are considering do not change that, although I welcome the important further clarity and safeguards offered on the Stormont brake.Dialogue with the EU has to continue so that ultimately we can move to a situation in which only items destined for export to the south are subject to EU rules and regulations in Northern Ireland. With pragmatism and advancing border technology, that should be possible. It is important that we continue to strive to bring that about, so that we can restore democratic control over making our laws in every part of our United Kingdom and Brexit is fully delivered for Northern Ireland, as it is for Great Britain.We also need assurances from Ministers that nothing in regulation 3 of the Windsor Framework (Constitutional Status of Northern Ireland) Regulations will prevent regulatory divergence between Britain and the EU. Of course, any responsible Minister must consider the impact of his or her decisions on the unity of the UK and its single market, but new screening obligations must not be allowed to create a chilling effect, which would stop us charting our own course with regard to how we regulate our economy. Taking back control of making our own laws was a key reason that people voted to leave the EU. We have yet to fully deliver that for Northern Ireland and, as I have said, we must go further on it in the future.Gavin Robinson (Belfast East) (DUP)I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for the conversations we have had on this specific point. She is right to highlight her concerns and to seek assurances from the Government, but she does accept that it is right to get assessments; that it is right that Governments should always be going through the process of assessing the impact of their decisions on every part of this United Kingdom; and that there is nothing wrong with transparency, with knowing any possible consequence, nor—if that potential consequence is negative—with all of us determinedly trying to ensure that it does not arise.Theresa VilliersI thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention; the dialogue that he and I have had over recent days has done a lot to reassure me that this package is about transparency, not a block on divergence. I hope the Minister will confirm that in his closing remarks, because divergence is important. The regulatory reform made possible by exit is, I think, crucial for our future economic success. By making us more competitive, modernising regulation is a key means to boost growth, raise living standards and reduce taxes.In conclusion, it took courage and determination from Northern Ireland’s elected leaders to secure peace after three horrific decades of terrorist violence. Asking very different parties to sit in a permanent mandatory coalition was never going to be easy, not least because some of the divisions between them date back decades, or even centuries. That devolved government has worked for so much of the past quarter of a century is a testament to Northern Ireland’s leaders and their determination to make the ’98 settlement work—to make Northern Ireland work. I pay particular tribute to the DUP in that regard: for so often it is they who have found ways to fix problems and keep devolved government going, while always safeguarding Unionist principles.We in this House must recognise the significant problems caused by the Northern Ireland protocol and the Windsor framework—including, of course, what the courts have described as a “subjugation” of article 6 of the Act of Union of 1801—but, as we have heard today, we are making real progress on tackling these issues by setting out in the statutory instruments stronger legal protections for access to the GB market. I also think that the historical perspective, as set out in annexe A of the Command Paper, is something that everyone should read. We are making progress on remedying these problems.It was a privilege for me, as Secretary of State for just under four years, to play a part in Northern Ireland’s inspiring story, and I truly hope that a way can now be found for its devolved institutions to resume their work of taking Northern Ireland forward to further success and an even brighter future.",Conservative
Hilary Benn,2024 Speech on the United Kingdom Internal Market,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/hilary-benn-2024-speech-on-the-united-kingdom-internal-market/,"The speech made by Hilary Benn, the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I begin byagreeing with the Ministerthat businesses in Northern Ireland want to make the current and future arrangements work, that they want them to work well and that there is huge potential for the people of Northern Ireland in the economic benefits that its current and future circumstances provide it.I have some specific points about the regulations— I see the Minister clearly relishes responding to those. Paragraph 81 of the Command Paper states:“We are now changing arrangements…to ensure…that checks are eliminated save for those conducted by UK authorities needed for the protection of the UK’s internal market on a risk and intelligence basis.Will the Minister clarify which checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be got rid of? Is he referring to identity checks, checks on paperwork or something else? At the moment, about 10% of goods using what is called the green lane—which will become the UK internal market lane—are subject to some checks on paperwork. Will he clarify what will happen to them?I welcome the amendments to the UK Internal Market Act 2020 provided for in regulation 2. Proposed new section 45A would reaffirm Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the rest of the internal market and ensure that no new NI-GB checks can be introduced. The regulation also makes provision for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to Departments on how they should carry out their duties under section 46 of the 2020 Act—namely, ensuring that they have special regard to, among other things, Northern Ireland’s status in the UK internal market when they formulate policy. Will the Minister confirm that guidance will soon be forthcoming and share any further details he can at this stage about what that will contain?I note the changes to the Definition of Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 made by regulation 3, which are intended to prevent Northern Ireland from being used as a back door for EU goods moving into GB and to protect Northern Ireland’s agricultural sector. Ensuring that NI-registered agrifood operators fully benefit from unfettered access is a very positive step and I welcome it. Will the Minister tell the House whether the Government envisage any further changes to the definition of qualifying Northern Ireland goods? I also note the Government’s confirmation in the Command Paper that“there will be no Border Control Post at Cairnryan.”That is greatly to be welcomed, but can the Minister say anything further about how checks and formalities on non-qualifying goods that enter GB from Northern Ireland through Cairnryan will work in practice?Let me turn to some of the other commitments set out in the Command Paper. Will the Minister confirm when he expects the new body announced to promote trade within the UK, InterTrade UK, to become operational, and how it will be overseen?I welcome the Government’s determination, which has been brought up by a number of Members, to ensure the continued supply of veterinary medicines into Northern Ireland beyond the end of 2025, when the current grace period expires. We all hope that an agreement can be reached with our European partners as soon as possible. I share the view expressed by others in the debate that we had the same problem with human medicines and, in the end, the EU recognised that something had to be done about that. I hope very much that the EU will show the same spirit in approaching this question. The Command Paper, however, says:“we will if necessary deploy all available flexibilities to safeguard and sustain the supply of veterinary medicines”.Will the Minister tell the House what those flexibilities are and how they will be applied if we get to that point?In approving the regulations—which I hope we will do unanimously as we just did with the constitutional set—we will be taking another step closer, in this really important week, to the restoration of power sharing. The people of Northern Ireland, who have been without a Government for so long, may not, in all fairness, be studying the regulations in the way that we are doing today, but they very clearly understand why they are essential to getting their Government back. Once we have done our bit today, it will be over to the politicians of Northern Ireland, and I am sure that every single Member of the House wishes them the very best in the task that lies ahead of them.",Labour
Steve Baker,2024 Statement on the United Kingdom Internal Market,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/steve-baker-2024-statement-on-the-united-kingdom-internal-market/,"The statement made by Steve Baker, the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I beg to move,That the draft Windsor Framework (UK Internal Market and Unfettered Access) Regulations 2024, which were laid before this House on 31 January, be approved.It is the view of the Government and, I believe, of the overwhelming number of right hon. and hon. Members across the House that the Union ought not be reduced to matters of the law or the constitution alone. Ours is a thriving economic, cultural and political Union whose health is insured, in no small part, by the free flow of trade across it. Enhancing that economic aspect of the Union is the purpose of this second set of regulations before the House today.The views of businesses and traders on the progress that we have made are also important in the context of today’s debate. I am pleased to confirm that the early reaction from business has been promising. The view of a collaboration of 14 key Northern Ireland industry bodies was clear yesterday in saying that they welcomed the agreement.The Government are clear that the old protocol created unacceptable barriers within our internal market, and I invite anyone to consider the full implementation of the old protocol against what we have achieved in the Windsor framework. The Windsor framework takes major steps forward, and I acknowledge that this is first and foremost an achievement of the Democratic Unionist party and also a great achievement of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.The framework restored the functioning of the UK internal market by ensuring the smooth flow of trade within the UK, and disapplied a range of EU laws, including ensuring that Northern Ireland benefits from the same VAT and alcohol taxes as the rest of the UK. Members of the House can also be encouraged by the smooth functioning of the framework since October 2023, when the first phase of arrangements came on stream, supporting trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I should just say that colleagues did ask me how it was going. I said, “Have you seen any news on it?” Of course, no one has; it has been going very well, and I want to thank and congratulate all those officials here and in Northern Ireland who have made that possible.These regulations go further in that aim to strengthen our UK internal market now and in the long term. Following the agreement of the Windsor framework, the border target operating model sets out that we will begin phasing in checks and controls for Irish goods and non-qualifying goods moving from the island of Ireland to Great Britain from 31 January—indeed from yesterday. This is a powerful demonstration of Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market, and it rebuts incorrect claims that it is instead a member of the EU single market. The reality is that third country members of the EU single market will now have full third country processes applied, while Northern Ireland’s businesses will have full unfettered access to their most important market in Great Britain.Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson (Lagan Valley) (DUP)The Minister is absolutely right. Perhaps the most powerful illustration of the change that we have secured is to consider what will happen now on the ferry route between Dublin and Holyhead as a result of these new arrangements. A Northern Ireland haulier using that service will board the ferry, travel to Holyhead, leave the ferry and travel straight out of the port and on to their destination, with no customs procedures and with full unfettered access. In contrast, a southern Irish haulier arriving at Holyhead will be subjected to full UK customs procedures at the port before they can proceed. Does he join me in welcoming Northern Ireland’s restoration fully within the UK internal market?Mr BakerYes. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in what he has just set out, and I do join him in that. It is a proud day for me, as it is for him, and I join other Members in congratulating him on his courage in bringing all of us this far.As a result of these regulations, we now have guarantees for Northern Ireland goods moving to the rest of the UK, via Dublin. This unfettered access is future-proofed, regardless of how rules evolve in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain. These regulations will more squarely focus the benefits of unfettered access on Northern Ireland traders. The regulations tackle avoidance of the rules and ensure that, for agri-food goods to benefit from unfettered access in avoiding sanitary and phytosanitary processes, they must be dispatched from registered Northern Ireland food and feed operators. We will also expressly affirm through these regulations that export procedures will not be applied to goods moving from Northern Ireland to other parts of the UK’s internal market.John Redwood (Wokingham) (Con)It has been said that maybe 80% of goods moving from GB to NI will be able to use the internal market lane. Why will 20% not be able to do so, and why would the UK Government, who I was told were in charge, not want to ensure that practically all goods use the internal market lane?Mr BakerWith great respect to my right hon. Friend, with whom I have gone a very long way in this cause, he might like to revisit the text. The point is that the 80% of goods going on that route are staying in Northern Ireland; they are UK goods. The other 20% are goods that are going on to the European Union. That is the point: 80% is UK internal market trade, and 20% is trade going on to the European Union.Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson rose—Sammy Wilson (East Antrim) (DUP)Will the Minister give way?Mr BakerI will. I cannot say that I am astonished; this is the important moment.Sammy WilsonDoes the Minister accept that all the statistics show that it is not true that 20% of the trade that goes through Northern Ireland goes to the Irish Republic? In fact, it is about 0.1% to 0.4%. Much of that trade, which will go through the red lane, consists of goods going into Northern Ireland, either to warehouses or to manufacturers in Northern Ireland. They might never go near the Irish Republic. They might stay in Northern Ireland, go back to GB, or go to the rest of the world, yet such products will still be subject to checks going into Northern Ireland.Mr BakerI would not accept that. I am not in a position to set out the statistics, and I do not doubt that the statistics need some work applied to them. It pains me to say this, as I have always regarded the right hon. Gentleman as a great friend—he and I have walked a long way together on this and I have always regarded him as an ideological bedfellow, both on the Union and on Brexit—but as his group leader, the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson), said earlier, we voted for, and fervently supported, the protocol Bill. We said that we were willing to have a red lane in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of our friends and partners—and family members, as the Irish ambassador Martin Fraser said. This was always a family dispute, and we were always going to get through it.Our friends in Ireland, and indeed in the EU, have legitimate interests, which we should have the humility to respect. Even if we had acted unilaterally as a single united Parliament, ridden roughshod over any international negotiation and just done what suited ourselves with the protocol Bill, we would have implemented the red lane. I am afraid that I will part company now with anyone who says otherwise. We would rightly have implemented the red lane, even acting unilaterally, out of respect for the legitimate interests of our friends and trading partners.Sir Jeffrey M. DonaldsonWill the Minister join me in welcoming the announcement on Tuesday of agreement on a joint legal text that will significantly change the status of goods coming from the rest of the world into Great Britain and travelling on to Northern Ireland? The effect of that change, which is part of the arrangements and the published Command Paper, will be that some 4 million goods movements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will now be moving out of the red lane and into the UK internal market system. That is this party delivering, and securing real change that ensures that more goods flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, save for those going into the EU or that are at risk of doing so because they are part of a manufacturing process for goods being sold to the EU.Mr BakerI strongly welcome that intervention. I thought that the right hon. Gentleman was going to mention the draft joint agreement on tariff rate quotas. For a while I was concerned that TRQs needed to be applied to Northern Ireland so that Northern Ireland could share fully in the benefits of free trade agreements with the rest of the world.I hope to return to this later, but in case I do not have the opportunity to do so, I want to say what an extraordinary situation Northern Ireland is now in. Northern Ireland is not in the single market. I draw everyone’s attention to page 4 of the Command Paper, which sets out checkmarks comparing Northern Ireland with Ireland, as a member of the EU, and with Norway, which is a member of the single market through the European economic area but is not in the customs union or the European Union. Northern Ireland really has the minimum of EU law compatible with unfettered—or privileged, perhaps—goods access to the EU market, and consistent with having an open, infra- structure-free border.I wonder at people who thought that we could leave the European Union and establish a hard border, or do absolutely nothing about the border. We were always going to leave the European Union and have special arrangements in relation to Northern Ireland. This is a moment of great feeling for me, because before the referendum vote, I and other colleagues set up a committee of Eurosceptics to consider how we might deal with these issues. I confess that we did not have the SPS and customs expertise to proceed. That then became the great story of this battle.If the United Kingdom had united in accepting the result of the referendum, if this Parliament had united in going forward with resolve to further our own interests as an independent nation state outside the EU, but crucially with the humility to respect the legitimate interests of our friends and partners, and if from the beginning we had had united resolve and clarity of vision, I do not doubt that in a spirit of friendship and good will—the kind that exists today between Ireland and us, and between the European Union and us, thanks to the work of the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister and others—we would have been, as we are now, in a totally transformed position to make our way forward as friends, respectful of their interests and resolved on ours.That is not what happened. The House does not need me to rehearse it. It has taken eight years of drama for us to arrive at this moment, when we have reduced EU law to this extent and put in place a red lane to protect the legitimate interests of Ireland and the EU. That is something that we should all be very proud of, after everything that we have faced and all the risks that could have put us in a far worse position.Paul Girvan (South Antrim) (DUP)I totally understand the need for a red lane to ensure that goods going into the Republic of Ireland are checked, but there is a business in Northern Ireland 98% of whose sales are into Northern Ireland. The stuff all comes to it in one container. Maybe 2% of that load might make its way into the Irish Republic as part of a service agreement with another dealer. I am talking about a major firm in my constituency that has an all-Ireland approach. That means that the red lane applies to every single item, even though 98% of its stuff is used in Northern Ireland, Scotland or England. It is a main distributor, and it will end up having to put all its goods through that. A job of work might need to be done to try to ameliorate its problems.Mr BakerThe hon. Gentleman is right that a job of work will need to be done; I assure him that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has just said that of course it does. I am grateful that we will be doing that further work in a spirit of good will and co-operation through the joint committee with the European Union. If the hon. Gentleman drops an email to my Northern Ireland Office address, I shall be glad to visit the firm with him, bringing officials, and we will see whether we can move further to assist it. I need to find out more about its exact circumstances.My goodness, that was a long series of interventions. This legislation ensures that we can avoid any unnecessary gold-plating in the implementation of new arrangements through new statutory guidance on section 46 of the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, setting out how public authorities should have special regard to Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market and customs territory, and the need to maintain the free flow of goods from NI to GB. We will take a power through the regulations to issue such statutory guidance, and public authorities will be required to have regard to it. Those changes to the law will help to ensure that public authorities take every proper effort to prevent new barriers to intra-UK trade. In doing so, they will maintain and strengthen the health of the UK internal market in the long term.Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP)One issue that greatly vexes those in my party is that farmers in my constituency, and in others, have said that vets now cost even more, as they have to source medicines and devices from an acceptable source. The Command Paper suggests that the issue has not been resolved but will be worked on. Is that a firm demand on the Government, or is it just another working group that will talk about things? My hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley) has been at the fore on this. We need a person on that committee to push things forward. If we have a solution through the committee, we need a timescale for delivery.Mr BakerWe understand that point and we are listening to the hon. Gentleman and others. We are resolute that of course Northern Ireland must have proper access to veterinary medicines, and will be glad to work with him and others. He will appreciate what the priorities are and have been, and we will certainly continue to make pursuing veterinary medicines a high priority. I am personally resolute on the issue and look forward to pursuing it.The regulations must be seen in the context of the overall package agreed between the Government and the DUP. The passage of these regulations demonstrates the Government’s commitment to taking forward that whole package and to maintaining the participation and trust of the whole community in Northern Ireland’s political processes and the Stormont institutions going forward.If I may touch on what the hon. Member for Foyle (Colum Eastwood) said earlier, I, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the whole Government are completely committed to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. As I said to one nationalist politician—about a year ago now, if I recall—it is perfectly possible to be a Unionist and support the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, just as it is possible to be a nationalist or a republican and support the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. It is the beauty and the triumph of the agreement that we can all support it and move forward.I am trying to say this as gently as possible: I can understand a degree of discomfort from the hon. Gentleman, because this is a big breakthrough for Unionism. A Unionist Conservative Government have agreed to do Unionist things with the Democratic Unionist Party, and that is something I am very proud of. However, that does not in any way diminish our impartiality, or our commitment to governing or seeing to the government of Northern Ireland in a proper manner.Colum Eastwood (Foyle) (SDLP) rose—Mr BakerBefore I give way to the hon. Gentleman, may I just say that I think, after the experience of the last eight years—perhaps the last 14—I need defer to no one in my vociferous commitment to democratic self-determination.Colum EastwoodThe Minister says he supports the Good Friday agreement in all its parts. Does he support the bit that says that the Government should be rigorously impartial?Mr BakerYes, I—[Interruption.] I do not quite hear the comment from the leader of the DUP.Sir Jeffrey M. DonaldsonNot on the Union!Mr BakerIt has long been said that this is the Conservative and Unionist party and we have long been understood to be a Unionist party. This agreement is entirely consistent with both our Unionism and our full respect for all dimensions of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. We will continue to govern in a spirit of good will and impartiality.Sir Robert Buckland (South Swindon) (Con)Will my hon. Friend give way?Mr BakerI will, but after I have given way to my right hon. and learned Friend, I will make progress and finish so that other colleagues can have their say.Sir Robert BucklandI have listened carefully to the interventions from the hon. Member for Foyle (Colum Eastwood) and the concerns that he and others will have about the scrapping of the legal obligation with regard to the all-island economy. Is the point not that while, as a UK Government, we have to uphold the rules that apply within our United Kingdom and the promotion of our own internal market, that does not detract from the access to the single market that Northern Ireland businesses will continue to enjoy? That is the compromise that has been reached here. Therefore there is not a binary either/or choice; the hon. Gentleman’s concerns can largely be met and continue to be met in a way that is fully in accordance with the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement.Mr BakerI agree with my right hon. and learned Friend, who demonstrates his expertise.I look forward as much as anyone to the re-establishment of the Assembly and the Executive, and along with that the re-establishment of the north-south institutions. They are much needed and I look forward to their work. I do not mind admitting that I find myself able to work constructively with politicians of all political parties in Northern Ireland, and I am glad to do so.Let me return, in concluding, to what is at stake in this process. I firmly believe that all parties in this House and all parties eligible to form part of an Executive want Northern Ireland to work. I have seen what unites political leaders in Northern Ireland: a real determination to make life better for their constituents—and, my goodness, on a wide range of fronts that is necessary—and to allow Northern Ireland to grasp the opportunities of the future—and what opportunities they are. I elaborated on some of the things Northern Ireland has before it right now. If we combine the institutional arrangements before Northern Ireland with the very substantial financial package to transform public services and deal with the public finances, and if Northern Irish politicians reach out and grasp the opportunity now before them, they can make Northern Ireland a beacon to the world—a beacon of prosperity and, I hope, of reconciliation. These regulations are part of that process and I commend them to everyone in the House.",Conservative
James Heappey,2024 Statement on Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy Eligibility for Afghan special force,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/james-heappey-2024-statement-on-afghan-relocation-and-assistance-policy-eligibility-for-afghan-special-force/,"The statement made by James Heappey, the Minister for Armed Forces, in the House of Commons on 1 February 2024.I am grateful for the opportunity to update the House on developments relating to the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme, and to answer the specific question raised by the hon. Gentleman in relation to former members of commando force 333 and Afghan territorial force 444.Many colleagues across the House are passionate advocates for applicants to the ARAP scheme—whether they served shoulder to shoulder with them in Afghanistan, or represent applicants and their family members who are residents in their constituencies. We owe a debt of gratitude to those brave individuals who served for, with, or alongside our armed forces in support of the UK mission in Afghanistan. Defence is determined to honour the commitments we made under the ARAP scheme, which is why we have robust checks in place and regularly review processes and procedures.Although many former members of the Afghan specialist units have been found eligible under ARAP and safely relocated to the UK with their families, a recent review of processes around eligibility decisions demonstrated instances of inconsistent application of the ARAP criteria in certain cases. The issue relates to a tranche of applications from former members of Afghan specialist units, including members of CF 333 and ATF 444—known as the Triples. Having identified this issue through internal processes, we must now take necessary steps to ensure that the criteria are applied appropriately to all those individuals.As such, I can confirm that the Ministry of Defence will undertake a reassessment of all eligibility decisions made for applications with credible claims of links to the Afghan specialist units. The reassessment will be done by a team independent of the one that made the initial eligibility decisions on the applications. The team will review each case thoroughly and individually. A written ministerial statement to that effect was tabled this morning, and I commend it to colleagues. A further “Dear colleague” letter will follow by close of business tomorrow.It is the case, however, that ARAP applications from this cohort present a unique set of challenges for eligibility decision making. Some served in their units more than two decades ago, and some while the Afghan state apparatus was still in its infancy or yet to come into existence all together. It is also the case that they reported directly into the Government of Afghanistan, meaning that we do not hold comprehensive employment or payment records in the same way as we do for other applicants.I fully understand the depth of feeling that ARAP evokes across this place and beyond. I thank Members from across the House for their ongoing advocacy and support for ARAP. We have that same depth of feeling in the MOD and in Government, and we will now work quickly to make sure that the decisions are reviewed, and changed if that is necessary.Luke PollardThank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this urgent question.The Triples Afghan special forces, trained and funded by the UK, are some of the top targets for Taliban reprisals. Around 200 Triples face imminent deportation from Pakistan to Afghanistan, and at least six members of the Triples are reported to have been murdered by the Taliban since the withdrawal from Kabul. Ministers have allowed media speculation to build for almost a week before setting out to Parliament today the Government’s plan to U-turn and look again at the applications.The Minister highlighted inconsistencies in processing the applications—failures, flaws. How was that allowed to happen on his watch? How long will the reviews take, and what new information will be factored in? Tragically, today’s decision could be too late for many. Does the Minister know how many of the Triples who were wrongly denied support have already been deported to Afghanistan, tortured or killed? What conversations has he had with Pakistan to halt deportations of those who could now be granted sanctuary? There is no time to waste.The least the Triples deserve is clarity over ARAP policy, but for months a public spat has played out between the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Minister for Armed Forces. We should all remember that the people who matter here are those Afghans who have been left in limbo, fearing for their lives and their futures. That is why clarity matters. Britain’s moral duty to assist Afghans is felt most fiercely by those in the UK forces who served alongside them, many of whom sit on both sides of the House. British personnel who have offered references to former Triples say that they were never even contacted by the Ministry of Defence. Many of their ARAP applications were denied. Will such basic errors happen again, or will that be reviewed properly?The British public do not understand why Afghan special forces personnel who served and fought alongside our troops and who are eligible for safety have not yet received sanctuary here. Will the Minister now sort this out?James HeappeyI know that the hon. Gentleman, who has been advocating for some cases and is as passionate about the matter as anybody, will feel aggrieved, as will many colleagues around the House. The responsibility of any Minister is to own any failure of process that happens in their Department, and I accept that responsibility.The reality is that these are very difficult decisions to make. The hon. Gentleman said that the Triples were funded by the UK Government. That is not entirely accurate; they were funded as a donor alongside many other donors, into the Government of Afghanistan, who funded the units. As he will well know from colleagues on his own Benches who commanded units that worked closely with the Triples, top-up payments were made in order to generate loyalty and, frankly, to avoid the Triples being poached by other coalition partners, which had similar forces of their own.The records of those top-up payments were very ad hoc. I take my responsibilities for accuracy to the House seriously, and I can tell the hon. Gentleman in all seriousness that we have looked for employment records and none of those ad hoc records of additional payments is available to us. We have spoken to colleagues who have experience of these matters in the House and beyond, to ask for any records that they have, but even then a lot of the records produced are those that are put together by charities advocating for the Triples, rather than contemporary records of those top-up payments.The reality is that whatever the challenges have been, some decisions were made in an inconsistent way. That is why they must be reviewed. We will aim to get the review done as quickly as possible—we anticipate that it will take around 12 weeks. Before that, we need to put in place the people who will do the review, who will be independent of everything that has gone before. In the first instance, it will be a review of the robustness of the decisions themselves, and where it finds that decisions were not robust, we will, of course, seek new information both from the applicant and from colleagues in the House who have advocated for them.The shadow Minister makes some good points about what this means for people who are in Pakistan. It is impossible to say who, of those who were not already in the pipeline as approved applicants, has been deported. We do not track that, so I cannot answer his specific question but, of course, we will alert the Government of Pakistan to those who are included within the review, so that they can enjoy the same protection from deportation as those who have already been approved and are awaiting their onward move to the UK.The shadow Minister necessarily points to the politics and the alleged disagreement among Conservative Members —that is the nature of his role—but I am simply not motivated by such things. The reality is that we are trying our best to bring as many people to the UK from Afghanistan as possible. Some decisions are relatively straightforward, because we hold the employment records, but others are far more complicated. Although there have undoubtedly been some decisions that are not robust and need to be reviewed, I put on record that the people involved in making those decisions, across the MOD, have been working their hardest and doing their best. I stand up for their service and for what they have done, and I take responsibility for their shortcomings.",Conservative

Grant Shapps,2024 Speech at the World Defense Show,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/grant-shapps-2024-speech-at-the-world-defense-show/,"The speech made by Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Defence, in Saudi Arabia on 4 February 2024.60 years ago, the skies above Riyadh bore witness to a remarkable demonstration as a supersonic aircraft shot into the atmosphere at twice the speed of sound.Just two years later and 40 of those iconic English Electric Lightning jets were heading to Saudi Arabia where they became as revered an icon of the skies over here as they were back in the UK.Yet that special flight also seemed to send our own partnership into the stratosphere.1964 saw the first British military mission to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, and 14 years after that we brought across a project team which has been supporting you with advice, information and communications service ever since.So that one pioneering flight demonstrated ours is a partnership built from the strongest of frames. An understanding of the value of Defence, an appreciation of the merits of innovation, and a desire to keep working together.And how fitting then that 60 years on, here at this fantastic World Defense Show, we are once again celebrating a partnership that’s putting on the afterburners.Not only can we reflect on a mutual commitment to combat air that’s taken us from Lightning, to Tornado, to Typhoon – with hundreds of UK military personnel now committed to Saudi programmes.But we have also stepped up the pace on the ground as well, with our Defence Cooperation Plan catalysing deeper cooperation between our Land Forces.However, my purpose in attending this great exhibition is not to reminisce about our past, nor even to reflect on our present, it is to talk about our future.Because if the incredible story of the Lightning tells us anything, it’s that when an opportunity arises in our mutual interests, we know how to seize it together.And frankly, when I look around me, I see opportunity abounds.Yours is a nation buzzing with energy. Creating new cities out of sand, redefining sport by hosting the World Cup in E-sports. Spearheading the charge towards a greener future.Yet if there’s one event that seemed to encapsulate your sense of ambition, it was what happened last year, when Saudi fighter pilot and astronaut, Ali Al-Qarni, and his crew member, Rayyanah Barnawi, became the first two Saudi astronauts to visit the International Space Station.Proof – if it were needed – that you are nation in fast forward.You’ve bottled lightning, and now you’re accelerating towards the future with increasing velocity.The UK wants to be on that journey with you. But there’s only one thing that can pull us back down to earth.Instability.For decades our prosperity and progress has been underpinned by the international rules-based order, yet today we live in a far more dangerous world. Our once reliable order is under threat from the likes of big state aggressors and from rogue states, whose terrorist proxies are hell-bent on destroying our freedom and damaging our wealth.So now is the time to tighten our ties.How? First by working together – in the words of your conference, to be equipped for tomorrow.Once upon a time we showcased a jet in your skies. Today we’ve brought more than 30 of our finest UK firms to your show, including a Wildcat helicopter, delivered by one of our Royal Air Force’s A400M transport aircraft.Demonstrating our skills not just in the air, but on land, sea, cyber and space. Our delegation are experts in power and engines, in critical components and complex weapons, in state-of-the-art surveillance and next generation electronic warfare.Our people know everything there is to know in mine counter-measures and military suspension and durable materials, 3D sensors, sonars, and uncrewed systems.But my second point is that we are looking for much more than a transient transaction.We want to build an even deeper industrial partnership.Saudi Arabia quite rightly wants to develop its own defence industrial base – and we want to help you get there – developing mutually beneficial capability programmes to support regional security.Already we have a deep industrial partnership stretching across air, land, sea and cyber.To take just one example, BAE’s workforce here in Saudi Arabia is almost 75 per cent Saudi.Which brings me to my third and final point: Both our nations share pressing strategic priorities.We both seek to calm conflicts. We both desire de-escalation. And even as Saudi Arabia aims for the stars, so its influence on terra firma is increasing too.It has a critical role to play in this region as interlocutors, as mediators and as leaders.So I see us doing more together to help shore up our international rules-based order. Doing more to ensure adherence to international humanitarian law. Doing more to prevent a breakdown in regional security, so we guarantee the safety and security of all people.Sixty years ago, we brought Lightning to this great Kingdom and helped transform our partnership.Sixty years on, we’re now looking to elevate our relationship to even greater heights.I, for one, am a strong believer that Lightning can strike twice.",Conservative
Stuart Andrew,2024 Speech at the Active Uprising Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2024-speech-at-the-active-uprising-conference/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Sports Minister, in London on 1 February 2024.Hello everyone,Thank you for the introduction, and for inviting me to speak today. I am delighted to be here with you all.Firstly I want to thank you all for the important work you do to help build a healthier and more productive nation. Being active promotes individual wellbeing, reduces loneliness and strengthens communities.A fit and active workforce also has a positive effect on employment skills and job readiness and contributes significantly to our economy.As you know, we recently published our new Sport Strategy, ‘Get Active’, where we set out our unapologetic ambition to build a more active nation and ensure the sector can thrive in the years ahead.As part of the strategy, we committed to the target of 2.5 million more adults and 1 million more children being classed as ‘active’ by 2030.Whilst the Government has a vital role to play in meeting this ambition, securing the sport and physical activity sector’s active involvement is central to making this ambition a reality. Each and every one of you can help us to make a difference.That is why, as part of Get Active, we launched the National Physical Activity Taskforce. It aims to connect government departments with the sector and independent experts, to focus on measurable actions that will get an additional 3.5 million people active.I am delighted that ukactive – as part of the National Sector Partnerships Group – is a standing member of the taskforce. This helps to ensure that your voice is heard and your views represented at the table.Lioness legend Jill Scott is also a permanent member of the taskforce, helping to provide a fresh perspective on how we get the nation moving. It is great to see that she will be joining you later today.Get Active also sets out our desire to ensure that our country has a sport and physical activity sector which is efficient and resilient – one which is financially robust and environmentally sustainable. The Government is committed to working in collaboration with all of you to achieve these ambitions.It is great to see that data will be a key theme throughout today’s conference. It is something that is a top priority for DCMS – helping to ensure the role and impact of sport and physical activity is articulated clearly.We have already come a long way as a sector in achieving this. We now need to ensure that the evidence base is indisputable, so that those ‘outside the tent’ can be convinced. We need all of you to do your part in helping push this forward, by sharing data and helping us react to its findings.A great example of where data is being used to empower the sector and drive forward participation is within public leisure. Alongside the private sector, public leisure provides a vital contribution to the wellbeing ecosystem.Sport England’s Moving Communities service helps us understand the social value of public leisure centres to those who use them most. They recorded over 211 million visits to over 1000 public leisure facilities in the last 12 months alone.  A third of those visits were to the gym and a fifth were for using the pool. These visits were made by just over 10 million people, with more than half women and just over a quarter under the age of 16.This data helps build a picture of what interventions are needed to get specific groups active and ensure there is an inclusive offer for all.This insight also helps open the door to understanding other opportunities where sport and physical activity could make a difference.As we set out in the Get Active strategy, facilities provide important community hubs, connect individuals with the areas in which they live and help to deliver on important social and mental health outcomes.The Government is playing its part – the Swimming Pool Support Fund is helping to keep the nation’s public swimming pools afloat. I am delighted that we have been able to support hundreds of swimming pools across England.In particular, through the Fund we are improving the energy efficiency and sustainability of facilities to safeguard them for future generations.This investment is part of our wider efforts to improve facilities across the country – with over £400 million from 2021 to 2025 which includes multi-sport pitches, tennis courts and swimming pools, to make sure every community has access to the facilities they need.Likewise, the Department for Health’s new WorkWell service will support Integrated Care Services in developing localised plans for work and health strategies. It is clear that both the private and public leisure sector have a role to play in this work in helping to empower individuals to get back on track.Nonetheless, there is clearly more work that needs to be done. Too many people are still not getting the benefits that being physically active brings.As a Government we continue to consider ways in which we can ensure that the sector has the conditions to enable it to prosper. Because we know the more active we are, the stronger and healthier our communities and economy, and the more prosperous our society.I thank you for all you do and I urge you all to continue to make sport and physical activity an essential part of everyone’s daily life.No matter how big or small your business, together, we can make a difference.I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference today –  and make the most of the opportunity to build connections across the sector and to share successes with each other.",Conservative
Alex Chalk,2024 International Rule of Law Speech in Washington,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/alex-chalk-2024-international-rule-of-law-speech-in-washington/,"The speech made by Alex Chalk, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, in Washington, the United States, on 31 January 2024.Friends, ladies and gentlemen.It is a huge pleasure to be here in Washington DC and an honour to address this distinguished audience.When Britain’s great novelist, Charles Dickens, who of course you all know, visited the United States in 1842, he wrote that on the occasions he encountered his fellow Brits here, the British displayed, and I quote ‘an amount of insolent conceit and cool assumption of superiority, quite monstrous to behold.’ I want to be clear that I am not intending to repeat that!I’ll do so not least as an admirer of America, and a humble student of American history at university. It was there I was first introduced to the defining principle, first set out by John Adams, of America as a ‘nation of laws, not of men’. And also as a barrister – i.e. attorney myself – of the inalienable right of citizens to be defended in court however unpopular their cause, also indelibly demonstrated by John Adams in his famous defence of British soldiers in the eighteenth century.The US today is, of course, a beacon of the values that our two countries demonstrate in the world – of democracy, of diplomacy and of deference to the international rule of law, and that’s what I want to focus on today: on the importance of the rule of law, the existential threats it faces, and how together we can – and indeed we must – face down these threats and emerge stronger.What do I mean by the rule of law in the international context? The idea that all nations are bound by common rules and principles that govern the way we interact with each other, no matter our size or power. And it’s underpinned by mutual consent and agreement, peaceful resolution of disputes, and regard for international institutions.My central argument is that we need to restate that these are not quaint notions to get dewy-eyed over, or trite phrases to trot out in seminars; rather they can be the guarantors of freedom, security and prosperity for all our people.And it’s worth pointing out that the order has brought about an extraordinary growth in international trade – indeed, the volume of world trade has multiplied roughly 45 times since 1950, while worldwide living standards have almost tripled. So this is no tedious law lecture. It’s food in citizens’ stomachs.But this is now under threat. The truth is we are in a global contest of ideas, a contest between rule of law nations like ours and those who offer an authoritarian alternative, a solution that says ‘might is always right’. And it means that a global post-war consensus, which we assumed was unshakeable now needs shoring up. But rather than letting complacency reign, we must reinforce the rule of law foundations on which it was built.We don’t need a history lesson to remind ourselves how the international rules-based international order came into being in the long shadow cast by World War II. What’s important is that it lit the way towards a new era: one based on mutual consent and common obligation…  where states could resolve their disputes peacefully, act with restraint, and hold each other to account for their actions. It allowed us to achieve a depth of international co-operation that would have been unfathomable just a few short years before.And this was properly expressed in the late George Bush senior’s visionary 1990 address to Congress following the fall of the Berlin Wall – which I was reminding myself of before I came here to America. As that authoritarian regime crumbled, he set out a vision of the world where in his words: ‘ the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak’.But the world is very different today. The accord they worked so hard to build is not just fraying at the edges, it is threatening to break down altogether due to the actions of international actors – such as Russia and Iran. Many believed – and this is important – that it had a remorseless momentum… that it would inevitably draw rising powers into its orbit… that its future would grow and was guaranteed. I believe the illusion and assumption that nations would automatically see the benefits of the Rules Based International Order has been eroded. But why? Why has it been eroded?The rule of law is being attacked on three fronts, contributing to this current crisis of consensus.First, the agreements that have helped secure the world’s stability and success since 1945 are no longer respected. By ‘those agreements’ I am referring to the legally recognised borders that have been the guardian of peace over decades. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the starkest but not the only demonstration.  And of course, it’s from a country, Russia, which after all is the successor state to the Soviet Union which signed and for a time broadly abided by arms reduction treaties for the benefit of all humankind.And looking further afield, when Hamas carried out armed incursions into Israel, butchering over a thousand innocent men, women and children in their homes and taking approximately 250 more as hostages, it was an unprecedented, and wholly unlawful assault.Amid this growing normalisation of illegality, of states disregarding borders and flouting international law, hostile geopolitical spheres of influence and indeed axes are being formed and strengthened in direct opposition to the Rules Based International Order. Recent assaults on commercial cargo ships in the Red Sea by the Hamas-supporting Houthis are just one example of these deadly alliances in action. And why have the Houthis been able to wreak so much havoc in the Red Sea? Because they are backed by agents of chaos in Iran.And all this geopolitical unrest brings me to the second threat to the rules-based order. The reality is that this unstable geopolitical landscape is making middle ground and non-aligned states feel caught in the crossfire of conflicts for which they bear no responsibility. They understandably fear the repercussions, and some are beginning to equivocate. Desperate to avoid the costs of dispute and conflict, states are left unsure which way to turn to seek reassurance, stability, and protection.And we must ask ourselves whether sustained instability of the type we are seeing risks making states like these feel they have no choice but to enter into alliances which undermine the Rules Based International Order. These alliances are pursuing a zero-sum outcome through fear, rather than mutual prosperity through shared values. They not only undermine the rules based order, but could shift the balance of power so the contest of ideas about how we should be governed – whether through the rules-based system as we cleave to, or through the chaos preferred by our competitors – is lost. So it is imperative that we ensure that non-aligned states and rising powers make the right choice.And what of the poorest and most vulnerable countries? This brings me to the third risk I think we must consider. Despite huge economic advances in the Global South enabled by the Rules-Based International Order, many of the poorest countries are struggling to protect their citizens from hunger, the effects of climate change and the impact of increased populations. That in turn can pull them into the orbit of authoritarian nations who offer them a quick fix.While rule of law underpins prosperity, its absence feeds poverty, insecurity and instability. And for citizens, this leaves many feeling they have no choice but to leave their home country and seek better opportunities elsewhere in the world. This has led to record levels of migratory movements, and fuelled illegal migration. It is clear that unmanaged illegal migration disregards borders and is putting unacceptable pressure on the national systems of rules-based countries like ours – as countries whose sovereign legislatures believe in, and consciously have chosen to be part of, the order I refer too.  The actions of criminal gangs smuggling people across borders brings those very rules into disrepute, particularly if they are perceived to afford, perversely, an unfair advantage to those who break the rules rather than those who abide by them.For rule of law countries in Europe, we are experiencing an influx of illegal migration. In the UK, that manifests as a steady stream of small boats across the English Channel bringing illegal migrants into our country. And in 2023, we saw a 36% reduction in the number of small boat arrivals compared to the year before, but we must continue to go further. Because we see dangerous tactics used by Organised Criminal Gangs to facilitate crossings and people who put their lives in the hands of criminal gangs. Too many perish. I know tragedies are also happening at your southern border.So, what does all this mean for the rule of law, and, crucially, how we strengthen it?Well as Thomas Paine put it in his rallying cry of 1776, “in America the law is king” – now those were heavily loaded words at the time. It meant, among other things, that the law is supreme. And if the law is supreme, it must have power, and if it must have power, it must therefore be respected. Put another way, it must be enforced.That means ensuring accountability, it means consequences. And it means bearing down on those who commit international crimes, until justice is served.And we can be proud of the leadership our two nations have shown. Together, we have, along with the European Union, established the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, to support Ukraine’s Prosecutor General with funding and expertise in the domestic investigation and prosecution of more than 120,000 alleged conflict related crimes.In 2022 the UK led a state party referral to expedite the International Criminal Court’s investigation into the situation in Ukraine, and we continue to support the ICC so it has the resources it needs to carry out its independent investigations. We welcome the recent legal changes here that have enabled America to assist the ICC’s investigation into the situation in Ukraine.And we continue to fight international terrorism in all its contexts. The UK and US were right to stand up to the aggression in the Red Sea by carrying out air strikes on strategic Houthi targets in Yemen, and the international community clearly accepts that it was the correct course of action in the circumstances.So, amid the contest of ideas, and conflicting narratives, it is incumbent on all of us – the UK, the US and our allies in the G7 and NATO – to show that the rules-based international order works and it is worth upholding.While others cause chaos, as part of the International Rules-Based Order – as nations who believe in the rule of law – it is our legal systems that are the engine room for prosperity across the globe, supporting trade the world over. English common law and US common law are the basis for no less than 27 percent and 20 percent of the world’s legal systems respectively.However, both international and domestic law must evolve if they are to meet the challenges posed by insecurity, and to win what I’ve called ‘the global contest of ideas’. Because, as Thomas Paine also famously said, “a state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation.”In the UK, we are making clear once and for all that it is Parliament that should decide who comes to our country, not international criminal gangs. Through landmark emergency legislation, we will control our borders, deter people taking perilous journeys across the channel, and help end the continuous legal challenges filling our courts. We are a humane, welcoming nation but it’s fair that everyone plays by the rules.Our legally binding removal treaty with Rwanda makes absolutely clear that individuals relocated will not be returned to a country where they might be placed in danger.But above all, the principle of relocating people to another country to have their asylum claims processed is lawful – the UK High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court too have found it to be so. Indeed, the UN Refugee Agency itself has its own scheme for refugees in Rwanda, albeit not through treaty.And look, the unique genius of the common law, of course, is its flexibility – its readiness to adapt and respond to societal changes and perspectives. As the UK Government has made clear, we need some of that same spirit when it comes to the challenge of uncontrolled migration, and the evolution of the rules-based system as a whole.As countries that believe in the rule of law, it’s crucial for us to demonstrate that it works for citizens in our own countries. For our justice systems that means that while we update them to make them fit for the 21st century, we must do so in a way which strengthens the values and principles on which they are built.Access to justice is a key part of that – probably the single biggest reason I came into politics – and the current era of rapidly changing technology is opening up new possibilities for improvement all the time. For criminal and civil justice, we must ensure that citizens can continue to access justice in ways that work for them today. And there are a number of important ways we can do this.First, by making sure our legal systems adapt to a changing world – updating our legal frameworks to take account of advancing technology, and fostering environments in which our legal professionals are properly equipped to practise the law both now and in a more technologically driven future.Second, by showing our communities and victims that criminal justice works – so that justice is not just done, but seen to be done. Whether that’s the worst offenders being imprisoned for longer, or those at the lower end of the scale repaying their debt to the communities they’ve wronged.Third, by harnessing new technology to ensure that the order of the Court is properly enforced. In England and Wales, GPS and alcohol monitoring tags mean we can deliver tough community sentences, avoiding short, costly stints in prison which research shows do little to reduce reoffending. I’m looking forward to visiting New York this week to see similar projects in action.Fourth, by developing digital tools to improve how individuals and businesses can access the law in ways that work for them, opening up early legal advice and support so they can, where appropriate, settle disputes outside of court.Fifth and finally, by keeping pace with advancing methods of delivery, such as transformational technologies like generative AI, and fostering innovation and the growth and adoption of lawtech – so that we can maintain the attractiveness as destinations for global businesses that are a boon to both our economies.In each area, there are opportunities; to improve justice for our citizens and to demonstrate our commitment to the rule of law; to show that we believe in its ability to make our societies fairer and allow them to flourish further; to show that we can evolve and adapt while our opponents remain rigid and dogmatic. These are some of the most powerful ways that we can make the case for the rules-based order.So look, as others have said before me, the relationship between our two nations is not just special – it is essential. Because when we stand together in the face of the chaos that our opponents seek to create… when we pursue accountability for the wrongdoing that others wreak on their neighbours… we will win the argument for the international order that our predecessors worked so hard to build and which has served the world so well.To end where I began, with Charles Dickens. As Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher observed when she visited Washington in 1981, Dickens was right to say that the people here are ‘…hard to deceive, prompt to act, lions in energy.’ Those are the qualities we need, you and us – as we fiercely defend the rule of law and make the case for a more secure and more prosperous future in the world.Thank you.",Conservative
Ed Davey,2024 Apology on His Involvement with the Post Office Horizon Scandal,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/ed-davey-2024-apology-on-his-involvement-with-the-post-office-horizon-scandal/,"The comments made by Ed Davey, the Leader of the Liberal Democrats, in theGuardian newspaper on 1 February 2024.The Post Office Horizon scandal is the greatest miscarriage of justice of our time, and I am deeply sorry for the families who have had their lives ruined by it. As one of the ministers over the 20 years of this scandal, including my time as minister responsible for postal affairs, I’m sorry I did not see through the Post Office’s lies – and that it took me five months to meet Alan Bates, the man who has done so much to uncover it.The Post Office is owned by the government but not run by it, so the official advice I was given when I first became a minister in May 2010 was not to meet Bates. He wrote again urging me to reconsider, and I did then meet him that October. But he shouldn’t have had to wait. When Bates told me his concerns about Horizon, I took them extremely seriously and put them to the Post Office. What I got back were categorical assurances – the same lies we now know they were telling the subpostmasters, journalists, parliament and the courts.",Other

Bim Afolami,2024 Speech at Bloomberg,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/bim-afolami-2024-speech-at-bloomberg/,"The speech made by Bim Afolami, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, on 25 January 2024.This building and indeed this city, but this building in particular, reflects the UK’s commitment to openness, competitiveness and innovation in financial services and the significant role that financial services can play in growing our broader economy, and there’s been a great deal of talk in recent months about this.Since 2010, the British economy has seen the third fastest growth in the G7 faster than France, Germany, Italy, Japan. It is clear that our long-term underlying growth rate needs to rise in order for us to deliver prosperity, lower taxes and more effective public services.And it’s right then, that our long-term plan for this country’s growth is our commitment to openness, competitiveness and innovation writ large.That’s why we’re cutting taxes, to ensure hard work is rewarded, and to allow businesses to take long, firm decisions and investment in R&D.That’s why we’ll continue to reduce our national debt, to fight inflation and deliver affordable mortgages for working people.That’s why, through investment, we will ensure that our supply of homegrown, clean, affordable power is matched by home grown teachers, doctors and nurses.Because since the beginning of 2023, we’ve seen real progress. Inflation and borrowing costs have fallen with inflation more than halving, our economy has bounced back, outperforming the forecasters, outperforming many of our European neighbours, and our national debt continues to fall.I know that all of you, not just in Bloomberg, will continue to monitor our progress closely. But today I want to focus on the role that our capital markets can play in building our economy for the future. Rising to our economic challenges and achieving Britain’s economic potential.Well, the first thing we should say is, well, what are we talking about? What are capital markets? Why do they matter? They play a key role in our economy because by allocating capital, facilitating investment, growth and job creation, they create investor returns. And those investors are not just international conglomerates. They’re British businesses. They are British people. And all of this drive’s activity across the economy.London in particular, is an international powerhouse with a foreign exchange market three times the size of the American one. The derivatives market 50% bigger than the American one, all of which helps to make us a global hub for investment.Now, I have, this Chancellor, this government, we’re not the first to recognise the potential of capital markets to grow the British economy in the 1980s, Nigel Lawson’s reforms, the Big Bang suspect, so to speak, unlocked the UK’s capital markets.However, in recent years they have lost some of the dynamism for which they became well known in that generation. We in this country have not been immune to the global shift away from public equities to private equity.According to a recent paper by McKinsey, total private market assets under management have grown at an annual rate of nearly 20% since 2017, which was the first year I was elected to parliament.But between 2015 and 2020, London accounted for only 5% of global IPOs, and the number of listed companies in the UK has fallen by about 40% from as recently as 2008, the year of the financial crisis. Now those, I’m sure you agree, are sobering figures. And we take that on, and we know that we need to change them. But to change them, we must first understand what’s driving them.A large part of this story is the success of New York across the pond. Over the past five years, the FTSE 100 increased by 12%, while the S&P 500 increased by 81%. Nasdaq has been very successful in attracting new listings, especially big tech firms. There, American home grown American tech firms like Apple, Meta and Alphabet.And interestingly, if you remove the seven big tech companies from the S&P 500, the gap in performance is not anything like as wide as one thinks. Indeed, at one point in time, and this is quite an interesting fact, at one point in time, Apple alone out valued the entire FTSE 100. And we are also seeing greater competition from smaller EU exchanges such as Amsterdam.It’s true however, there has been a broader trend over the past decade or so of a change in British investor behaviour, with domestic British investors shifting away from investing in UK equities and moving beyond our shores. Why has that happened?My thinking after speaking with I don’t know how many people in the last few weeks a month since taking this job. Is that our approach to capital markets must carefully balance appropriate regulation with investors’ appetite for risk. And our post 2008 approach has focused too much on the former and not enough on the latter. In part that reflects the culture mindset of the government and our regulators.Now, as many of you may know, I’ve spent some time in this office and beforehand making the case for the importance, the importance of risk in our society. And I pushed against the modern trend across the whole Western world. It’s not just Britain. Pushed against the modern trend to seek to eliminate all risk, which has only accelerated after the Covid pandemic.Now, look, this is an understandable, but it’s a deeply damaging instinct. We have to move faster. Yes, with speed limits and controls. But accepting that innovation and growth cannot come and an entirely risk free environment.As I argued in my remarks to the FT banking summit, which was, I think, the first public statement I made in this post. There is no point us in the UK having the safest graveyard.Through a journey of root and branch reform. We need to move from a risk off to a risk on outlook, to move from a complacent incumbent mindset to an insurgent one, whilst recognising the challenges that we face because it’s only through measured and purposeful risk taking that we can deliver progress, economic growth and a capital markets renaissance.Here’s what we’ve already achieved. Here’s what we’ve already done. First step on our reform journey was to properly diagnose the problem that started in earnest in 2020, the end of 2020 with my very good friend Lord Hill. The UK Listings Review, which built consensus across government and the industry on how to boost IPOs and capital raising on UK markets.Then 2021 Mansion House, our then Chancellor, now Prime Minister mapped out our destination and he said he wanted a more open, competitive, technologically advanced financial services sector. And he launched the Wholesale Markets Review to consider how we could use our newfound regulatory freedoms to make UK markets more competitive. So having diagnosed the problem, next came our solutions.Reforms progressed across all areas in our legislation and regulatory regimes, but also in the culture and mindset of government and regulators. On the legal and regulatory front, we have passed a huge act, the new Financial Markets and Services Act 2023. This delivered the Wholesale Market Review’s most urgent changes, and as a result, firms can now trade in the most liquid market and get the best price for investors.We’ve also set statutory growth and competitiveness objectives for our regulators, established the new Regulatory Complaints Commissioner, Rachel Kent, who is here in the front row. So, she is, to ensure that regulators are fully accountable to market participants as well as accountable to consumers. And we’ve worked hand in hand with industry to carefully review every single aspect of our rulebook.Now, this issue is very close to my heart. As the former chair of the Regulatory Reform Group in Parliament, which I set up. I’ve long been a critic of the accountability gaps in our regulatory system and the disproportionately anti-growth mindset of many regulators.However. As my thinking has evolved over time, I’ve come to understand the responsibility that politicians have, not just regulators. Politicians from all parties. We as politicians must take a lot more responsibility for this. We created the system and incentives that the regulators operate in, whilst often blaming them for not acting fast enough on an issue of consumer harm, and then staying silent when industry complains about an ever more complex and costly rulebook.This culture of risk aversion has been very present in politics as much as it has been present in the regulatory state, and this must change. So be in no doubt. While I’m closely monitoring how the new system breaks down and closely monitoring how our regulators take on this growth and competitiveness objective that we have given them.I will act and we will act further if we don’t see a sensible shift in our regulators toward more pro-growth mindset. At the same time, I want to lead a cultural shift within our politics and within our politicians. More immediately, we are taking forward a host of new initiatives like the Digital Security Sandbox, which will test the use of distributed ledger technology in trading and settlement. That’s just one of the huge range of reforms coming up stream. The results of these reforms is that after three and a half years, we are now within sight of making the UK’s public markets match fit again.But you and I know we must go further to fully deliver on the promise of our capital markets. The regulatory and legal reforms are a necessary but not sufficient condition. So let me tell you about the steps that we are taking now to go further, because we’re supporting companies through every stage of their investment life cycle.First, we will ensure that companies can scale up effectively so that they are primed and ready for listing. To do this, we are establishing a world first, a new class of exchange, which will allow private companies to raise capital on an intermittent basis.Now, the private intermittent securities and capital exchange system. And this came across my desk and I said, guys, this isn’t going to work. I don’t even understand what that is. So, what I did was I played around with the acronyms with the words, and we’re going to call it Pisces. Pisces for short will be established before the end of this year.The Pisces platform will give private companies better access to UK capital markets, break down the artificial regulatory cliff edge that exists between the public and private markets. This development will allow us to take advantage of the structural shift that I was discussing earlier to private markets, rather than suffer from.Secondly, we want to ensure that when companies choose to list, when they do that, the process of doing so is as frictionless as possible. And as I’ve now taken the UK’s new prospectus legislation through Parliament in recent days, the FCA can now complete their entire rewrite of the prospectus regimes rulebook to deliver on the recommendations from the Lord Hill reforms and indeed the Mark Austin reviews. This will boost the operating environment for our capital markets in two principal ways.First, by increasing the pool of investors in participating capital raises and enabling firms to raise larger sums of capital more quickly and more easily.Finally, we want to ensure that once listed companies are matched with the best investors for their offering, we will achieve this by taking forward Rachel Kent’s Investment Research Review recommendations.We aim to revive the research market, which has been damaged in recent years, by delivering more efficient and accurate pricing, in particular for small and medium sized businesses, whilst attracting a more diverse range of investors, including retail investors.And I’m not going to have any more time to list some of our wider initiatives, like Charlie Gatlin’s Accelerator Settlement Taskforce, which will upgrade our back office operations for the 21st century by moving from a T2 to a T1 settlement, or our form of Solvency II which were released 100 billion pounds of investment into our economy.But given present company that, of course, seeking a balance of risk and reward, I’m prepared to make a bet with you about our future delivery of these reforms and then make a bet with you. This is dangerous. The Mansion House 2024 will mark substantial progress in all three of the investment lifecycle stages that I’ve set out today.First, the FCA’s new listing rules will consolidate our dual segment structure into a simpler single listing segment. And that would have narrowed the gap with our international competitors. I am confident that as part of this transition, the FCA will engage with firms who want their IP to benefit from our new regime, ensuring that the UK IPO pipeline is ready for action.Secondly, we will be well on our way by Mansion House midway through this year to delivering the regulatory framework for Pisces by the end of 2024.And finally by taking forward Rachel Kent’s IRR recommendations, the Investment Research Review recommendations, we will allow much more investment research to be produced in this country on smaller, mid-cap British businesses giving more information to investors, particularly retail investors.Now, why am I so confident in this agenda? Well, partly that’s just because that’s an occupational hazard of being politicians. But in all seriousness, I’m confident in this agenda. I’m saying it to all of you today because it’s underpinned by our commitment to where I started to openness, competitiveness, growth, dynamism, innovation in financial services. That is not for financial services. It is for the British economy as a whole.Now, I know, or at least I hope very strongly that the people in this room share those values. When they are properly applied, they will have an impact far beyond financial markets. After all, the Big Bang improved the lives of millions across this country. And I’m confident that when we have delivered our capital markets renaissance, those will too. Thank you.",Conservative
John Glen,2024 Speech at the Institute for Government’s Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/john-glen-2024-speech-at-the-institute-for-governments-annual-conference/,"The speech made by John Glen, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, on 23 January 2024.Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s a pleasure to be here with you all today.I would like to start by thanking the Institute for Government for hosting this event. In particular, thank you to Dr Hannah White for her engagement leading up to it. I enjoyed your blog and the recently released Whitehall monitor.Today, I want to outline the next steps of civil service reform and how I will build on my predecessors’ work to make the Civil Service a lean, keen and productive machine.But, before I look to the future, I would like to look to the past.Modernisation and reform have always been a crucial part of the Civil Service.In fact, the modern Civil Service was born out of a report f- as I’m sure many of you know – from 1854, one that argued the case for urgent reform.The Northcote-Trevelyan Report focused on creating a permanent Civil Service based on integrity and honesty.Now, I’m paraphrasing here, but the report ends by stating: “Our priorities are, to provide efficient public servants, to foster merit, to overcome the fragmentary nature of the service”.To get the best people to encourage good work, to improve the structures of central government.It could have been written yesterday, but actually next month that report celebrates its 170th anniversary.I think these priorities will speak to the public’s concerns. They want a public service that is easy to navigate, one where the best people are in the right jobs, where their lives are made easier by Government decisions.It’s these priorities that I will discuss today and how I will seek to help the Civil Service to achieve them.Recent Change & Future ChallengeNow, the size of our Civil Service has always shifted.It shrunk following the financial crisis after 2010, in 2016, it grew to deliver Brexit and it grew in 2020 to respond to the pandemic.It’s clear that if the world changes, the Civil Service must change, too. And this is right – the public would expect an adaptive and agile service, one that can respond to the big challenges facing the country.Just think of the Furlough scheme, the AI Safety Summit, or all the work that’s gone into making us one of the highest performing education leaders in the world, these are significant achievements worth remembering.It is also worth remembering the range of roles in the Civil Service.They make up our government departments, agencies and public bodies, but they’re also the people who translate policies of politicians into action.They work incredibly hard but crucially hard work does not always equal great productivity.We must improve to keep pace with innovation in the private sector. For too long, productivity in the public sector has not been a high-enough priority, we have thrown more people at our biggest challenges, but have more to do to embrace the potential of technology and innovative ways of working.As a recent Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I know that public finances are tight, they are always tight. Having established the Public Sector Productivity Review, I focused on squeezing every pound to deliver for taxpayers and I carry that focus with me in my new role in the Cabinet Office.I know how important it is that the Civil Service cracks its productivity puzzle, because doing so will open the door to greater productivity across our entire public sector.We can only afford a Civil Service that embraces innovation, especially when we consider the challenges ahead.Demand for public services is growing – not just because of the immediate cost-of-living pressures, but an ageing population means we need to carefully consider many of our policies.The cost of running Government is also increasing – tech costs more, and Government debt costs more to manage.So, we have a public that is rightly expecting more, but it is also costing us more just to stand still.As the Minister responsible for Civil Service reform, I am relentlessly focused on its future.It is clear we have to do more with less, but I don’t think it’s about cutting corners.It’s about being more productive. It’s about encouraging the best possible performance. It’s about bringing our people with us, to embrace the possibilities that modernisation brings.Changes Already MadeNow, I hope I’m not arrogant enough – 10 weeks into the job – to think I’m the first to recognise these challenges.My predecessors have set some fantastic work in motion already – most recently Sir Jeremy Quin, and not least the inimitable Lord Maude and his series of reforms. I was happy to discuss this speech with him yesterday evening.The foundation for my work is the Declaration on Government Reform led by Michael Gove in 2021, where all permanent secretaries and the Cabinet agreed a programme of reform.It was an ambitious programme focussed on greater efficiency and productivity – and we’ve already made some great progress.Like merging 200 legacy IT systems into 5 corporate services.And we’ve moved 16,000 London Civil Service roles into cities like Aberdeen, Cardiff, Wrexham and Belfast, making a Civil Service representative of the public it serves.That’s all good, but what’s missing?For me, there are three areas we can focus on to accelerate Civil Service modernisation: embedding technology, embracing simplicity, and enabling people’s potential.Embedding TechnologySo, first, let me turn to technology.My vision is that every single civil servant is either actively delivering – or enabled by – digital technology in their day-to-day job, whether that’s eliminating bureaucracy. or coming up with new ideas to support our citizens.Much of the focus is on how we in Government use AI, but I am clear that is not an inevitable solution.AI will only work if it’s properly embedded, if it’s clear why and how we’re using it, and that civil servants get the right training and support to use it well.I’m pleased to say we are already taking exciting first steps to unlock the benefits of generative AI, ensuring that our AI teams are working with industry experts, in order to solve some of the public sector’s most pressing problems.Like launching AI pilots to make it easier for people to claim compensation in the case of criminal injury.I believe better use of technology allows us to encapsulate everything that I’ve already spoken about: powered by the right people, it will improve how we deliver to the public at lower cost.For example: before, if you wanted to sign a mortgage deed, complete a DBS check, or manage your company’s apprenticeship scheme, you had to sign in to each specific Government website, re-enter your personal details again and again and again.So, we released a Gov.UK app that uses the One Login system, it’s already been downloaded 4.5 million times, and it has whittled 29 service logins down to just one sign-in process.It’s so successful we’re rolling it out to over 100 other services this year.It’s a great example of how we can better serve the public especially where they engage directly with public service.Embrace SimplicityBut tech and artificial intelligence are not a one-size fits all solution to our issues, I believe there is a lot we can do by simplifying our processes.Inevitably, the Government is – and always will be – a complex organisation. But I fear that now, it’s more complex than it needs to be.Complex processes hide inefficiencies, simplifying how we work will make the Civil Service more productive, and will help us improve public services.I want to acknowledge the work of my Ministerial colleague Esther McVey, who has come into her new post in the Cabinet Office to root out our inefficiencies.She brings a refreshing clarity and analysis to how the Government works, a clarity which I – and the public – truly welcome.It was a vision shared by Lord Maude, who also wanted to see improved accountability.Today, we are considering ways to improve accountability in the Civil Service, including accountability to ministers.The public expect no less, because they too want the processes and services they use to be more straightforward.Take Universal Credit, for instance: it replaced a complicated landscape of multiple benefits administered by multiple organisations.When we were delivering it, people were complaining it was taking too long, but we stuck to it, and steadily implemented it, and now, five years after its introduction, the change it has brought is remarkable.It provided essential support throughout the pandemic rapidly, and will save £650m per year by 2027.Now – that was a big idea with big benefits and it didn’t just happen.It took the combined effort of civil servants, local councils, politicians and thousands more to make it work.I pay tribute to them all, who – over half a generation – have transformed this complex service into a simple and productive one.Projects like that demonstrate how our approach to policy development needs to change.It needs to prioritise productivity as a goal from the outset, and ensure we are building an evidence base demonstrating which interventions work and which don’t.But it’s not just the public-facing work we need to reconsider we also need to re-evaluate the labyrinth of processes that make up the back office of government.That means doubling down on the functional reform agenda that Lord Maude began.Which is why we introduced functions in 2013 to raise standards of specialist work across government.Renewed approaches to functions like commercial, finance and project delivery have delivered £7.8bn in efficiencies just between 2020 and 2022.But we need to go further, and actually create a way of doing things that gets things done well and done quickly.So let me give you an example of the kind of efficiency I’m talking about.Let’s say you’re a new civil servant, and it’s your first day in a Government department.You need to get an ID card, but security clearance is a rigorous process, and for some that can take many months, so you get a temporary pass.You need a laptop, but I.T. don’t have one available, so you have someone else print out all your induction material, and you remain offline for a while in a very online world.It’s now a couple of weeks. Without proper access to the building, you don’t have a laptop and you don’t have an online account, and to resolve each one of these pressing issues, you have to speak to a different person.Does this sound productive to you? Of course it doesn’t.From launching a job advert to getting that new civil servant sat at their desk, takes – an astonishing average – of up to 115 days.We can, we must and we will do better.Which is why we are piloting a new model to make one person accountable for this process end to end, making sure that new starters in the Civil Service can start quickly with all their needs met and be productive from day one.Enabling People’s PotentialThat leads me on to my final focus for my speech – people.Undeniably, people are the Civil Service’s greatest asset, but I believe that the current system is letting us all down and doesn’t enable our staff to achieve their best.Complex structures mean that measuring progress can be difficult, our ways of incentivising high-quality performance are limited, people feel like the only way they can progress is to shuffle roles, all leading to dissatisfaction which, of course, results in the Civil Service churn being too high.It’s a serious challenge for us – one which the IFG says costs the public nearly £36m a year on recruitment, training and loss of productivity.We know that pay isn’t everything for civil servants, but it is undeniable that it is a deciding factor for them to move roles.Pay, too, can prevent the external talent the Civil Service desperately needs.Only one in five successful Senior Civil Service recruits is external, and vacancy rates for crucial digital and data professionals are at 15%, which undermines our digital transformation ambitions.So, my ambition is simple: a smaller, more skilled Civil Service that is better rewarded.Its simplicity masks the challenge, however, in implementing it, but I believe the time to make that change is now.Which is why I am pleased that we are reviewing our pay framework for digital and data professionals, to ensure these roles can compete with similar roles in the private sector, especially those that will be at the forefront of AI delivery.Not only will this attract and retain talent, but it will also save the taxpayer money, with savings of up to £270m by reducing reliance on expensive contractors.My message to today’s tech leaders is this: yes, the Civil Service is doing everything it can to compete on pay – but no tech giant, no FTSE100 company, no unicorn anywhere will ever compete with the level of the work you will do in the Civil Service.I have been fortunate enough to work in a number of Government departments, alongside many great people and some of them are here today. I’m loathed to name any of them individually, yet the commitment they showed me, the great advice they have given me, and go the extra mile –  all this allowed me to achieve everything I could.That environment often comes down to the culture our line managers create, they help improve performance, giving their teams clarity, support and accountability.When line management is done well, it is transformational. There are over 100,000 civil servants with line management duties and, if they’re good at their job, this can improve productivity by providing clear expectations, training and support for their teams.We also know that standards of performance management can too often vary between teams and departments.Staff might not be getting full, honest feedback that helps them address issues, or help them progress their career at the right pace.That is why we will be setting out the line management standards we want across the Civil Service and providing the support to managers they need to achieve these.Yet, in some cases, consistently underperforming staff can languish in roles, or move between departments without properly addressing the reasons for poor performance.In the worst cases, managers can too often feel unable to remove consistently poor performersThis is a problem that needs a solution, which is why I’m pleased to announce that I will work with Civil Service leaders to review our performance management approach.This will build on the best practice already happening across much of the Civil Service and it’s only fair to our staff that we support them with proper, honest management.But let me be clear – we are not dodging our responsibilities to deal with bad performance.Where there is consistent poor performance in a very small minority of staff, we must take necessary action to address that.It’s something which is a cause of real frustration for our civil servants – particularly senior civil servants – some of whom can feel they have to tiptoe around a colleague’s lacklustre performance, or have to work extra hard to make up for it.It’s just one of the many things that frustrate them which can be resolved by better management. Another is working from the office.There is no denying that there are many benefits to colleagues working all together in an office. People can be more productive, and complex tasks often can be overcome more efficiently.I have already set out the expectation for staff to be in the office at least 60% of the time, and I believe that our senior civil servants need to set an example as leaders.I want to consider how this expectation can be baked into our management of senior staff, which is why we will be making this distinction clearer for senior civil servants at the start of the performance year.Ultimately, I want staff to bring themselves – their ideas, their passion and their dedication – into the office to tackle problems together.I’ve already spoken about how we are building a public sector that reflects the society it serves, but I know there have been questions raised on the role of staff networks in supporting that effort.Now, I’m sincerely grateful to the work of civil servants to make their profession open and inclusive.Staff networks can create collaborative spaces, build a sense of belonging, helping us to work across-departments.But, managing these networks should not become a second job.I believe we have an opportunity to improve how these networks operate and ensure they do not impact our broader productivity.So I have been working with Ministerial colleague Esther McVey to look into how staff networks operate across the civil service, and we will be publishing guidance in due course.We must also ensure these networks uphold the Civil Service’s long-established rules on impartiality.That’s why we are introducing new impartiality guidance which will support Civil Servants to remain objective when engaging in diversity and inclusion work.We must make sure our civil servants can express themselves and maintain the trust and confidence of the public.ConclusionSo, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen – whether it’s in 1854 or in 2024 – our civil servants have the capacity to adapt to the challenges of the day, but we must adapt today to prepare for the urgent challenges of tomorrow.Over the next six months, I will address these and other Civil Service priorities, including the use of consultants in the public sector, and the responsibility of public bodies to the government.But, for today, I want to reaffirm the kind of Civil Service I want to help create: a Civil Service that can meet the productivity challenge, where the most innovative and inspired minds are called to serve, to stay, and to be successful and fulfilled, where our processes are borne of robust evaluation, where innovation supports how people actually use our public services.Our citizens deserve nothing less, and I believe we can do so much more to serve them better.Thank you very much.",Conservative
Anne-Marie Trevelyan,2024 Speech at Asia House Annual Outlook,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/anne-marie-trevelyan-2024-speech-at-asia-house-annual-outlook/,"The speech made by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Minister for the Indo-Pacific, at Asia House in London on 23 January 2024.It is a real pleasure to be here again for the launch, gosh in a blink of an eye isn’t it, the 2024 Outlook. And it really doesn’t seem like a year since I was standing at this lectern, predicting I think as I was, ‘months of change ahead’. But I wasn’t entirely wrong because it has indeed been a busy year and an awful lot has happened.Now we did know even then that we were going to be looking at an unpredictable year, but I’m not sure that any of us would have anticipated the scale of events that has impacted economies over the last year, from the continuing challenges around climate change, to cybersecurity, from the conflicts in Ukraine which continue to create huge strains and of course in Gaza, US-China competition, the really substantial impacts we’re seeing through BRICS expansion and of course the Saudi-Iran deal.And not wishing to be a predicter I think 2024 is probably going to be equally unpredictable. As you mentioned we have got elections in 60 countries, over 2 billion people going to the polls. Which is an extraordinary thing when you think about that sort of voice being spoken from citizens across the world. It is actually a global first – from Bangladesh and Taiwan in the last few weeks to India, Indonesia, South Korea, Sri Lanka… our own UK general election at some point, I can give you no insider information, and of course at the end of the year the USA’s Presidential election.So I think Lord Green is right to talk about ‘turbulence’ in the coming year. But there will be 2 things that will remain consistent in 2024. One of those is Asian growth, and the other one is the UK’s commitment to be at the heart of that.So we’re going to be continuing to seek those deeper partnerships with all these amazing countries across the Indo-Pacific, and with the regional network in partnership withASEAN, the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), amongst others.I had the great pleasure toattend the IORA Ministerial in Colombo in October last year, and indeed thePacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands in November. I spend a lot of time on planes these days, some of which work better than others. I think what I’ve heard time and again from my counterparts, in spite of their very diverse interests, was a desire for the kind of stable world order that will support economic growth and genuinely allow sustainable development. Because that stable world order in which we can all win that race for climate security, and of course the health security. And a stable world order that gets that prosperity that every country needs back on track.Now the Foreign Secretary has called this an ‘age of insecurity’, and that insecurity can fan out both by land and by sea. And of course the recent situations in the Red Sea are a blunt reminder of what that looks like.Something that became particularly stark in 2023 is that Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific security are clearly inseparable. Understanding that, and for that reason, that’s why the UK and so many of our partners want to be part of sustaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. Simply put, it is in our interests for the Indo-Pacific to be secure and stable. And it is in the interests of the region’s people to build a free, fair future, where top quality trade rules are respected, trade routes can stay open, data and energies can flow freely, and countries have free choices.So theUK’s deployment of HMS Diamond in support of Operation Prosperity Guardian, an international taskforce to protect commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, is perhaps a clear example of the UK’s intent. On maritime security, I’m looking forward to continuing engagement with the AUKUS partnership this year, as well as working with some key Indo-Pacific partners to assure global waters are safer for everyone.The UK knows that security and trade will form a virtuous circle in our relationships throughout Asia. In 2023 we saw a number of notable successes for this approach, as we signed our Accession Protocol to theComprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership– CPTPP – that was in July. Now joining CPTPP is going to give UK businesses an extraordinarily exciting enhanced access to the Malaysian market for the first time, and it puts the UK at the heart of a dynamic group of free trading countries, which are in the right place, and at the right time.And we of course have ourFree Trade Agreements with AustraliaandNew Zealandcame into force last year, with an expectation to increase bilateral trade by 53 and 59% respectively over the long term.And in May we announced the expansion of British International Investments (BII as it’s known) to the Indo-Pacific, which is going to invest up to £500 million of climate finance. And we’ve also agreed theUK-Singapore Green Economy FrameworkMoU.These are pillars if you like in the UK’s continuing growth and development of that commitment to the Indo-Pacific. More widely in support of regional security and stability, we’ve agreed aReciprocal Access Agreement with Japanin January last year. The UK is the first European country to agree an RAA with Japan, which is enabling both countries to undertake longer, larger, more frequent and more complex joint exercising. And we are also sharing our cutting edge technology through the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP for short), to strengthen our deterrence and defence and the signing of the GCAP treaty with Japan and Italy in December was a really important milestone for that.We’ve also been strengthening important bilateral relationships, with a newStrategic Partnership with Singapore, and theDowning Street Accord with the Republic of Korea. The Downing Street Accord commits both sides to deeper cooperation on defence and security, on trade and investment, on science and technology and on wider global issues together.Now all of these relationships require a degree of trust. Trust that there are certain rules of engagement that the parties agree to follow. 2023 saw an important moment in this regard, as the UK, China and 27 other countries signed theBletchley Declaration at the AI Safety Summit, to voice our mutual concern at the dangers of unfettered AI development, and to work together on safety research. This work is a cornerstone of the UK’s leadership in digital transformation, as we carve out our role in a new technical world this year.2023 also saw publication of the UK Government’sIntegrated Review Refresh, which set out the UK’s approach to global threats more widely, as well as our approach to the UK-China relationship. As Permanent Members of the UN Security Council together, each with a powerful global reach, the UK’s relationship with China has enormous potential to overcome some of the greatest global challenges together. So I welcomed China’s attendance at the AI Summit and also the UK-China engagement on climate change at COP28.The COVID pandemic taught us that it is prudent to reduce dependencies in our critical supply chains, but we do believe that a positive trade and investment relationship with China is also critically important for both our countries’ interests. So we must maintain open channels to discuss all areas of our relationship, including where we have concerns. That includes the deterioration of freedoms in Hong Kong and the need to preserve peace in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. These are matters of global interest. And so following Taiwan’s recent elections, I hope that those on both sides of the Strait will renew efforts to resolve differences through constructive dialogue. It is important that engagement between the UK and China continues to grow throughout 2024, and I am very pleased to be joined here today by our esteemed colleague, His Excellency.Looking to the opportunities to come, Outlook 2024 rightly notes the importance of digital transformation to support economic growth. We know that AI and other critical technologies have the potential to transform our societies and improve the lives of millions. So we will build on the AI Safety Summit and continue to spur collective international action to navigate both the opportunities and the risks of this new frontier. We seek to ensure public safety, to drive commercial benefits and to promote values in line with our democratic ideals, assisting businesses in the process.On trade, we’ve continued negotiations on our UK-India Free Trade Agreement: a deal to boost our current trading relationship, already worth £38 billion, and we are working to upgrade the UK-KoreaFTAas announced during the recent State Visit, to enhance our existing £18 billion trade relationship with South Korea.And of course, our ambition is to complete the required domestic procedures to join CPTPP as soon as possible, with the aim of completing that in the second half of this year. This is all before we mention the long-term benefits that membership of CPTPP presents for the UK: that stronger voice to shape global standards in areas like digital trade, more resilience and security in our supply chains, and more opportunities for jobs and growth right across the UK.And as Asia House correctly foresees, this will likely be a turbulent year. Therefore, 2024 also needs to be a year of patient diplomacy, as we continue to put in place these long term frameworks that will build the range of partnerships required to protect UK prosperity and security and to support global efforts to tackle those shared challenges. Whether those frameworks areFTAs, defence and security arrangements or innovative approaches to mitigating the impacts of climate change.So it is my great honour, as Minister for the Indo-Pacific, and our superb team of Ambassadors and High Commissioners around the world, to understand our partners’ priorities and to respond to them and work with you. We will encourage and work with our brilliant businesses, our investors, our entrepreneurs and their counterparts across the region to maximise these opportunities, for 2024, and for the long-term. Thank you.",Conservative
David Cameron,2024 Speech at the Holocaust Memorial Day Reception,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2024-speech-at-the-holocaust-memorial-day-reception/,"The speech made by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, at King Charles Street in London, on 23 January 2024.IntroductionYour Excellency, distinguished guests, today we honour the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust – humanity’s darkest hour.We reflect on subsequent genocides, in Rwanda, Cambodia, Bosnia and Iraq. And we recommit to rid the world of the prejudice and hatred that persists today.Let me begin by thanking those who work so hard to support this work, including the Holocaust Memorial Day and Holocaust Educational Trusts, who both do so much to sustain memories and understanding.I would also like to thank Ambassador Hotovely for joining me to host today’s event and for her remarks.There are lots of days in your life that you remember. I remember the birth of our first child. I remember the death of our first child.But there are 2 other days that I will never forget. One was a winter’s day 9 years ago where I had the privilege of visiting Auschwitz.It’s an extraordinary thing to go through. And, of course, you are struck by this massive architecture of murder, these famous archways, the mechanics of deaths, the scale of murder.But what really hits you is when you see those displays of the luggage, the suitcases piled high. The children’s toys taken from the children before they were killed. The hair taken from those that went into the gas chamber.These are things you never forget when you see them. And it’s so important that children have the opportunity today to see first hand what this architecture of mass murder is all about.That’s why it’s important to say, ‘never again’ and to hear this testimony. That’s why the work you do is so important.But there is another day that I will never forget, and that was the attacks on 7 October last year.Not long after the event, I stood in Kibbutz Be’eri. The first thing that strikes me is what a place of peace it is. Built out of nothing in the desert, inhabited by people who went to make a life and a future for themselves and their families.But then you go house to house, and you can see the bullet holes in the walls. The blood on the floors. The cupboards where children hid before they were pulled out and murdered in front of their parents. The appalling death and destruction on what was, let’s remember, the deadliest assault on Jewish people since the holocaust.And since then, not only have those people had to live with that tragedy. Not only have they had to live with the fact that there are still 130 more hostages in Gaza whose fate we are so worried about and who we want to see released so badly.But there has been this upsurge in antisemitism here in Britain as well as elsewhere.So, in my view, it has never been more important to say so clearly that we stand with Jewish people. We stand with the state of Israel, We stand with their right to defend themselves as they go through this terrible ordeal with the legacy of the holocaust. And that’s why it’s so important we are gathered here today.Diplomacy and freedomWe gather today in the Foreign Office, with me standing before you as Foreign Secretary, to recognise that diplomacy is a profession dedicated to building bridges. To strengthening alliances. To promoting peace and freedom.The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and the HolocaustAnd this is a department with its own history. Today we are all telling stories about this period in history, and I want to tell you a quick story about what this department did.Many British diplomats saved lives in the face of hatred and tyranny. I want to share with you one example.From 1938, a brave team of Foreign Office and church officials in Vienna took huge risks, provided travel documents and baptismal certificates for Jews who were desperate to cross Austria’s borders to safety.Reverends Hugh Grimes and Reverend Frederick Collard carried out hundreds of baptisms every day. Officials led by Thomas Kendrick and George Berry worked around the clock to exploit every possible loophole to issue travel permits and passports.It was a dangerous business. Two members of this group – Kendrick and Collard – were harshly interrogated by the Nazis. The Jewish-born verger of Christ Church was sent to Auschwitz, where he died.But thanks to the courage of some 25 individuals, tens of thousands of lives were saved.Until recently, their devoted efforts were unknown. But the FCDO were determined they should not be forgotten. So last March, relatives of survivors joined us, faith groups and Lord Pickles, in unveiling a plaque at the British Embassy, opposite Christ Church.KindertransportBritish officials also played a role in that great rescue operation led by Jewish organisations 85 years ago.That operation saved thousands of children from Nazi persecution in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia.I’ll never forget meeting one in Number 10 Downing Street when she showed me the little pocketbook that her father had written when she got off her train. It just said, ‘be a good daughter to the country that gives you hope’.But while many children found safety here, they paid a high price – the murder of their parents, who were not allowed to accompany them. Freedom, for those children, was indeed fragile, and tinged with what must have been deep and abiding sadness.So, we are equally determined this story – in all its complexity – is not forgotten. Last year, during the first State Visit of his reign, His Majesty the King and German President Steinmeier paid tribute at a memorial to the Kindertransport in Hamburg.The present dayI share these stories as we must truly grasp their lessons for today. These are once again dangerous and volatile times. We and our partners must show strength and unity if we are to defend freedom.In March, the UK assumes an important mantle, the Presidency of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.We will use this opportunity to explore the circumstances of the Holocaust, and highlight the nature of societies that allowed mass murder to take place. And crucially we want to emphasise that these things take place in plain sight, and we must shine a spotlight on all those who had a part to play.We want all generations to grapple with the legacy of the past, and recognise its relevance in the present. Because with memory of the Holocaust soon to pass from our living history, we must never allow it to slip from our consciousness.After the horrors of 7 October, we must renew our vow – never again. That is our solemn duty – today, tomorrow and always.Thank you.",Conservative
Chris Heaton-Harris,2024 Statement on Public Sector Pay,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/chris-heaton-harris-2024-statement-on-public-sector-pay/,"The statement made by Chris Heaton-Harris, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 18 January 2024.Today’s strike will be disruptive for people across Northern Ireland. I understand the serious concerns that people across Northern Ireland have about the impact this action will have on vital public services.While public sector pay is devolved, the UK Government has offered a fair and generous package worth over £3bn which would address public sector pay and provides more than £1bn to stabilise public services. This will require Ministers being back to work in Stormont so that decisions on governing can be taken in the round.I am deeply disappointed that the significant funding offer from the UK Government to address such issues has not been taken up. This package has been on the table since before Christmas and will remain there, available on day one for an incoming Northern Ireland Executive.It is regrettable that the NI Parties were unable to come together yesterday to elect a Speaker and restore the executive. The people of Northern Ireland deserve local political leadership from representatives they have elected to govern on their behalf.The UK Government has made a significant offer that would help address the challenges facing public sector pay and Northern Ireland’s finances. It is time for the NI Parties to take decisions on how they will best serve the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.",Conservative
Victoria Atkins,2024 Speech to the Women’s Health Strategy,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/victoria-atkins-2024-speech-to-the-womens-health-strategy/,"The speech made by Victoria Atkins, the Health and Social Care Secretary, on 17 January 2024.Thank you so very much everyone.Can I just say, I’ve been looking forward to today.Because, apologies gents, but I view this as a sort of feminist’s Christmas.So, it is a genuine pleasure to be here with you all. I know there are incredible leaders here in what we are trying to achieve in women’s health.There are women in this room who are midwives, nurses, doctors, healthcare professionals and leaders.There are women who do amazing work through charities.There are women who campaign on issues.And, of course, there are women here who have told their stories, in public, so that others know that they are not alone.And to all of you, I say thank you.You are making our NHS a better service for us all.And I also want to promise you that I get it.Because women’s health and maternity care is one of my top priorities as Health Secretary.Because we are more than half the population, and our healthcare matters. Not just to us as individuals, but to our families and wider society.Now, as Maria rightly said, we have already come a long way, and transformed many lives by driving forward theWomen’s Health Strategywe launched some 18 months ago.But together, we can go further still.I want to reform our NHS and care system to make it faster, simpler and fairer for all of us – and that includes women.Because for me this is personal.The NHS diagnosed me with type 1 diabetes at the age of 3.So, I have seen the very best of the NHS.But I have also seen some of its darker corners.One of those darker corners was when I was pregnant.As the clinicians in the room will understand, pregnancy with type 1 diabetes can be a very medicalised process. And there came a point in the pregnancy when it became clear that the baby was going to have to be delivered early.And so, I was rushed into hospital – and the hospital that looked after me amazingly well simply did not, at that point, have the facilities to look after someone who was both very early in pregnancy, but also with complications.And so they put me in a ward with women who had just given birth – literally rushed from theatre – who had had very traumatic experiences.And you will understand how deeply worrying – and dare I say it, frightening – it was to be lying in that ward with women who had gone through, frankly, a hellish experience. Who were in agony, who were needing very urgent medical treatment.And for me to be there ready to have my baby.Looking back, I know that everybody was doing their best.But I desperately want to ensure that women who are expecting, and who find themselves needing a bit of extra help are not in that situation, and they’re not facing the fear that I faced.So, I absolutely get it.And it is very much personal for me.But I want to set out some of the policies this year that will help light the way to better health and happiness for women.And I’m going to start with a number.Two hundred and ninety three.From the independent research published last week, that is the number of women who died in pregnancy or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy in the 3 years between 2020 and 2022.That number means that 293 families are grieving the profound loss of a mother – who will also be someone’s daughter, partner, wife, sister or friend.And their babies who have lived – their loss is indescribable.They will never know the warmth of their mother’s cuddle.The tinkle of her laughter.Or the limitless love that we have for our children.Not all of these deaths are linked to poor maternity care, but many will be.And this must stop.Important, and frankly stark, reviews into maternity services have identified how, why and where mistakes happen and harm is done.And in response, NHS England has set out a large programme of work to tackle this through itsmaternity and neonatal services plan.This includes the establishment of 14 maternal medicine networks across England. Which will ensure that women with medical conditions that pre-date, or develop during pregnancy, from cardiac disease to diabetes, all receive the specialist care they need.Fairer access to services must be achieved, and underperforming trusts must shape up.To achieve this, a Maternity Safety Support Programme is giving underperforming trusts assistance before serious safety issues arise.And I will give these and other measures my full backing to support families, and to end preventable maternal and baby deaths.Because the birth of a child should be among the happiest moments of our lives.And for the overwhelming majority of families, of course – it is.We want this for every woman, and every family.But this commitment also requires a laser-like focus on birth trauma.Some mums endure simply unacceptable care and live with the consequences of that trauma for the rest of their lives.Some have told their stories to the media – harrowing experiences of tears, prolapses, operations and agony.They’ve done this because they want to shine a light on the impact of such experiences.Some of those amazing mums are here today in the audience.You deserve our thanks, our admiration and our applause.And the importance of women speaking up for other women is demonstrated through the work of my colleague, Theo Clarke, the MP for Stafford.Theo suffered a horribly traumatic birth. And when she regained her strength, and returned to work, she called a debate in the House of Commons on birth trauma.This was the first debate on birth trauma in the centuries that we have had a Parliament, and this shows some of the journey we still have to travel.And when you spoke, Theo, women around the country heard you and responded – sharing their stories too.Theo is now leading an inquiry into birth trauma on behalf of Parliament, with the backing of the Birth Trauma Association, and I encourage any mother who has been through a traumatic birth to share their story with this inquiry.But I am impatient, and I want to see progress quickly.We recognise that pregnancy and birth can take an enormous mental and emotional toll, particularly if a woman has to deal with physical illness too.This was demonstrated in the case of a young woman who passed away when extreme pregnancy sickness left her unable to eat, drink or complete daily tasks.Thanks to the advocacy of her MP, Sara Britcliffe, and others, specialist maternal mental health services will be available to women in every part of England by March.So, thank you Sara, and thank you to all the women who have campaigned for that.And we want to take care of the physical injuries caused in traumatic childbirths, which is why we are rolling out comprehensive physical care for those who experience serious tears during childbirth by March as well.But sometimes, a simple and thoughtful question is what is needed.“Are you ok, Mum?”This year, every woman who gives birth will be offered a comprehensive check-up with their GP within 8 weeks, focused solely on her mental and physical health – in other words, asking her whether she’s ok.Now, the baby girls born to these amazing women in our NHS will of course grow up into young women.For most girls and women, starting our periods is a part of life.It’s an extra thing we have to think about. It’s annoying at times, it’s sometimes painful, but it isn’t life-impacting.For some girls and women, however, their periods are a time of severe pain and exhaustion which they come to dread because of the impact it has on their lives.Painful periods and conditions such as endometriosis can stop girls and women from living their lives to the full – preventing them from going to school or to work, playing sport, from meeting their friends, or even starting a family.We are going to hear from Emma Cox later about her work to educate us all about endometriosis.But she and I have already met, when in my previous role, I was Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Now. in that role, I was responsible for the UK’s tax system. And it tended to involve rather dry discussions about the interpretation of tax law.So, after I’d settled in, I decided to bring a little more human into the Treasury – which is a very imposing institution.And it turns out that the Treasury can do human.Because last year, at the 2 fiscal events, the Chancellor announced the removal of VAT on period pants.And also asked the Office for National Statistics to investigate the impact of endometriosis on women’s employment, so that we can find solutions to ensure that we are helping them to live to their full potential.This is a groundbreaking piece of work and is part of the government’s commitment to ensuring women can lead full and fulfilling careers.And to mark that announcement, I invited Emma and women living with endometriosis into Number 11 Downing Street, so their voices were heard at the very centre of government.A few months later as Health Secretary, I am proud that we will build better guidance on endometriosis for healthcare professionals, so they can offer women the right treatment at the right time.But periods and pregnancy go together.We should also be able to control when and if we fall pregnant.We have therefore made contraception more accessible through our Pharmacy First programme.From December, oral contraception is now available on more high streets, using our pharmacists to their full potential – making it faster, simpler and fairer for women to access this healthcare.We will also roll out long-lasting contraception through women’s health hubs – which brings me onto our next priority.We will expand women’s health hubs so that every integrated care system has at least one hub up and running.So that women across England will be able to benefit from faster, simpler and fairer comprehensive care for menstrual problems, menopause, conditions such as endometriosis and contraception.We will also make sure hubs provide care that meets more women’s needs.Whether that’s making it quicker and easier to access long-acting reversible contraception, like coils and implants.Or setting up information sessions and consultations to help women understand their menopause.Or facilitating smooth and speedy referrals to specialist hospital treatment whenever it’s needed.Women’s health hubs benefit women and they benefit our NHS.They boost efficiency, they reduce unnecessary hospital referrals and they end the obstacle course of appointments women face to find the care they need.This is why we support them, and this is why we are expanding them.I have already said that I want to reform our NHS and social care system to be faster, simpler and fairer.And that point about fairness is shown shockingly in maternity.Black women are almost 3 times more likely to die while giving birth, or shortly after, than white women.Women of Asian ethnic backgrounds are 1.67 times more likely to die while giving birth, or shortly after, than white women.In modern Britain, this is absolutely unacceptable.And I want to thank the Women and Equalities Select Committee for carrying out an inquiry and amplifying this issue.We are serious about ending maternity disparities. And I have confidence that we will do this.Not only because of the intensive work in the NHS that I have set out, but also because of our unique status on the international stage.The world is on the cusp of a healthcare revolution.Researchers are discovering answers to the largest and most intractable healthcare issues facing all developed economies.The UK is at the front of this race.We are genuinely a world leader in life sciences.We have the largest life sciences industry in Europe, and businesses around the world are moving to the UK because of the tax and investment regimes we have built over the last decade to encourage them.And I am delighted to welcome pioneers in femtech here today.But we want to go further and faster.So, I am delighted to announce the launch of the first ever Research Challenge, worth £50 million, to tackle maternity disparities from the National Institute for Health and Care Research, the research arm of the Department of Health and Social Care.This spring, the call will go out to research teams for their ideas.By autumn, they will be innovating together, finding ways to give mums a helping hand before, during and after pregnancy.And I am hugely optimistic about what this can achieve. And this is just one of the projects we are funding to improve women’s health.Recently, I met 2 inspiring women who have been diagnosed with an aggressive and very difficult to diagnose form of breast cancer.Lobular breast cancer accounts for 15% of breast cancers, yet far more research is needed into its symptoms and treatments.Thanks to their campaigning, and the support of their MPs Jeremy Quin and Dehenna Davison, we will encourage more research into lobular breast cancer and other under-researched women’s health issues. As well as conditions that affect women and men differently, such as heart attacks.So that the symptoms we suffer from are recognised as symptoms that are perhaps different to the symptoms men would suffer from.It is precisely because we have such an established system of healthcare and research, with committed workforces and plans for how to meet these challenges, that I am confident about the future.We are making long-term decisions to support, strengthen and safeguard the health and wellbeing of women up and down the country.And my ministerial colleague and friend, Maria, has done so much to bring about real change for women. From new women’s health hubs toHRTfor less than £20 a year.She does this while still practising as a nurse.So, an enormous thank you to Maria.Thank you for everything you do as an MP, and as a minister, and as a nurse.But there is another woman I would like to thank as well, our Women’s Health Ambassador, Dame Lesley Regan.I know Dame Lesley is raring to do even more than she has already achieved.And so, I am very pleased to confirm that we are reappointing Dame Lesley as our Women’s Health Ambassador for another 2 years.Thank you, Dame Lesley.So, this is our 5-point plan for women’s health.Maternity care that every mother can have faith in.Better care for menstrual problems.More women’s health hubs offering more treatments.Improving fairness and tackling inequalities and disparities.And more research into the health needs of women.In my very first speech as Health and Social Care Secretary, I said I was an optimist.And I remain an optimist.I’m optimistic about Britain’s long-term future, I’m optimistic about our NHS, and I’m optimistic about what the Women’s Health Strategy can achieve in 2024.By working together, we can build an NHS that is faster, simpler, and fairer for women across the country.And build a future that is brighter for our children and grandchildren.I want to thank you all for helping us achieve this – thank you very much.",Conservative
Chris Heaton-Harris,2024 Statement at Hillsborough Castle,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/chris-heaton-harris-2024-statement-at-hillsborough-castle/,"The statement made by Chris Heaton-Harris, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 15 January 2024.Today I have met  representatives of the main Northern Ireland political parties to discuss why it is important an Executive is restored before the clock ticks past 18th of January.As you know, at that point, a duty falls upon me to call an election and I will need to decide on various other important matters that require primary legislation in Westminster.In my meetings today I emphasised it is now 23 months that the people of Northern Ireland have been without the locally-elected politicians they voted for, taking the decisions needed to tackle the issues faced by people and businesses across Northern Ireland.And I outlined the generous financial package offered to the parties before Christmas, worth over £3 billion, that is currently available from day one of a reformed Executive.A financial package which provides solutions to many issues raised by the parties, including money that would enable a restored Executive to give public sector workers a pay award.I also emphasised that the Windsor Framework talks with the DUP had effectively concluded. I’m pleased to say that we were able to make some further progress last week, and today I have urged all the parties to take the next step and form an executive. It is hard to see any barriers whatsoever to stop this from happening as soon as possible.The people of Northern Ireland deserve to have the people they voted for, working for them.In recent weeks, we’ve seen strikes across Northern Ireland’s public sector over pay and I know more are planned for Thursday.The industrial action taken by the unions will disrupt the lives of many people across Northern Ireland.Public sector pay in Northern Ireland is devolved.This is properly a matter for locally-elected politicians who are best placed – and I quote others here – “to tackle the unprecedented challenges confronting citizens…public services, particularly the immediate matter of public sector pay today” in Northern Ireland.If an Executive has not been reformed by Friday, then, as I say, I will have various decisions to make and I will set out my next steps in due course.To end, I do believe that all the conditions necessary are now in place for the political representatives of Northern Ireland to govern on behalf of the people who elected them.It is time for talking and debate to finish. It is time for Stormont to get back to work.",Conservative
Grant Shapps,2024 Speech on Defending Britain from a More Dangerous World,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/grant-shapps-2024-speech-on-defending-britain-from-a-more-dangerous-world/,"The speech made by Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Defence, at Lancaster House in London on 15 January 2024.Thirty-five years ago, Margaret Thatcher gave a short speech here in Lancaster House.She spoke of her optimism about the changes taking place between East and West. Barely two weeks later the Berlin Wall fell.It was the dawn of a new era. Existential threats were banished. And a new global feel good factor spread to Defence.This was the age of the peace dividend. The notion that while our defences should be maximised at times of tension they could be minimised in times of peace.Conflict didn’t disappear of course. But with no great power menacing the continent, peace gave the impression of being just around the corner.Yet, not everyone got the memo. In fact our adversaries were mobilising.The belligerent autocratic state was making a comeback – having got away with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin launched his brutal invasion of Ukraine eight years later.And as Russia continues its illegal campaign in Ukraine, China is assessing whether the West loses its patience.Today, Russia and China have been joined by new nuclear, and soon to be nuclear, powers.North Korea promising to expand its own nuclear arsenal.And then there is Iran, whose enriched uranium is up to 83.7%, a level at which there is no civilian application.Back in the days of the Cold War there remained a sense that we were dealing with rational actors.But these new powers are far more unstable, and irrational.Can we really assume the strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction that stopped wars in the past will stop them in future, when applied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard or North Korea?I am afraid we cannot.Particularly since there is now another new worrying consideration: Our adversaries are now more connected with each other.For example, we have seen how Iranian proxies are causing havoc from Israel to the Red Sea.That Russia has what the two countries describe as a “no limits partnership” with China – with whom they conduct regular joint exercises.Meanwhile, Putin is relying on Iranian drones and North Korean ballistic missiles to fuel his illegal bombardment in Ukraine.With friends like these, the world is becoming more dangerous and has done in recent years.But the other threats that plagued the start of the 21st century haven’t gone away.The spectre of terrorism and threats from non-state actors, as October 7 showed, still haunts the civilised world.Put it all together, and these combined threats risk tearing apart the rules-based international order – established to keep the peace after the Second World War.Today’s world then, is sadly far more dangerous.With the UN reporting that we are facing the highest number of violent conflicts since the Second World War.Now some argue these threats are not existential to the UK.And yet, what happens elsewhere, quickly happens here.In the past few years we’ve seen terror attacks on the streets of London, attempted assassinations in Salisbury, theft of Intellectual Property, attempted interference in our political processes, a cost-of-living crisis, brought to you by Putin, that’s hurting families here at home.And now, our trade. 90 per cent of which comes by sea, is the target of terrorists.Proving that not only do our adversaries have the intent to target us but they have a widening array of weapons with which to wreak havoc.In our online world our adversaries don’t need to jump in a tank board a sub or strap into a fighter jet to hurt us.Cyber warfare simply means hacking into our networks and watching the economic carnage unfold.Last year, almost a third of businesses in the UK suffered a cyber breach or attack. And the total cost to the UK economy runs into billions.We know significant numbers of these attacks come from Russia and China where they are also developing satellite killing technology, capable of degrading us from space.Even mass migration can be cynically used against us as a weapon of war, as Poland, Norway, and Finland have been experiencing.In other words, nation states plus non-state actors with greater connections between them plus more creative weapons all adds up to more trouble for the world.Over the last decade this government has made great strides to turn the Defence tanker around.The refreshes of the Integrated Review and Defence Command Paper have been instrumental in ensuring Britain is defended in this more dangerous world.We’ve uplifted our defence spending – investing billions into modernising our Armed Forces and bringing in a raft of next generation capabilities, from new aircraft carriers to F35s; from new drones to Dreadnought submarines; from better trained troops; to the creation of a national cyber force.And when the world needed us, we have risen to the moment.Giving Ukraine our unwavering support and galvanising others to their cause, including with our biggest ever funding package, announced last week.Taking action, we work to stamp out the global ambitions of Daesh.We’ve acted at the forefront of global responses to maintain regional stability after October 7th by sending a Royal Navy Task Group, a company of Royal Marines, surveillance planes and lifesaving aid to Gaza.And taking a lead role within global forces to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.Not only that but we’ve strengthened Britain’s place in the world with expanded partnerships from the Gulf to the Indo-Pacific.We’re playing a major part in stirring the West into a renewed commitment to defence, using our 2014 NATO summit in Newport to bring Alliance nations together to stop the rot, by committing to spending 2 per cent of GDP on Defence.Today, for the very first time this government is spending more than £50bn a year on Defence in cash terms, more than ever before.And we have made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5% of GDP spent on defence.And as we stabilise and grow the economy, we will continue to strive to reach it as soon as possible.But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same.And ensure their defence spending is growing.Because, as discussed, the era of the peace dividend is over.In five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Ask yourselves – looking at today’s conflicts across the world – is it more likely that the number grows, or reduces?I suspect we all know the answer – it’s likely to grow. So, 2024 must mark an inflexion point.For Ukraine, this will be a year when the fate of their nation may be decided.For the world, this will be the greatest democratic year in history with nearly half of the world’s population going to the polls.And for the UK it must also be a moment to decide the future of our national defences. The choice is stark.Some people, especially on the left, have a tendency to talk Britain down.They believe Britain can no longer have the power to influence world events.That we should somehow shrink into ourselves and ignore what’s happening beyond our shores.I passionately believe these unpatriotic, Britain belittling doom-mongers are simply wrong.Their way would lead us sailing blindly into an age of autocracy. So we must make a different choice.And the history of our great island nation shows us the way.Britain has often accomplished the seemingly impossible before. Our history is littered with moments when we faced down the threat and triumphed.But looking ahead, we are in a new era and we must be prepared to deter our enemies, lead our allies, and defend our nation.In terms of deterrence, it’s about the UK gaining a strategic advantage over our enemies.The foundation of that advantage is, of course, our nuclear enterprise.At a time of mounting nuclear danger, our continuous at sea deterrent provides the ultimate protection.And that’s why we are spending around £31bn to bring in next generation Dreadnought submarines and upgrade our deterrent.In a more contested world, we need to bring that same goal of deterrence to our conventional forces – so we have made modernisation a critical priority.Taking the long-term capability decisions we need to transform our Armed Forces into a formidable deterrent.Enabling them to maintain the UK’s strategic advantage and empowering them to be able to deliver the outcomes we need in multiple theatres at once.The growing success of that work was powerfully shown last week when, in less than 24 hours, the UK was able to both take action to defend ourselves against the Houthis and uplift our support to Ukraine to new record levels.If Putin thought we’d be distracted by the events in the Middle East then last week, because of the long-term decisions this government has taken, his hopes were surely dashed.In a complex world, no nation can afford to go it alone, so we must continue strengthening our alliances so the world knows they cannot be broken.Defence is in many ways the cornerstone of our relations across the world.Our world leading Armed Forces, cutting-edge industrial base and willingness to support our allies is the reason why Britain is the partner of choice for so many.And among our partnerships, NATO remains pre-eminent. 75 years after its foundation, today NATO is bigger than ever.But the challenges are bigger too.That’s why the UK has committed nearly the totality of our air, land and maritime assets to NATO.But, in 2024, I am determined to do even more.Which is why I can announce today that UK will be sending some 20,000 personnel to lead one of NATO’s largest deployments since the end of the Cold War, Exercise Steadfast Defender.It will see our military joining forces with counterparts from 30 NATO countries plus Sweden, providing vital reassurance against the Putin menace.Our carrier strike group will be out in full force, with our magnificent flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth leading the way.And flying from her decks will be the fifth generation F35 lightning jets, accompanied by a fearsome phalanx of frigates, destroyers and helicopters.We’ll also have a submarine patrolling the depths and one of our Poseidon P8 aircraft conducting surveillance from the skies above, and more than 400 of our brilliant Royal Marines will be training in the Artic Circle, contending with some of the toughest environments anywhere on the planet.On land, we’ll be deploying over 16,000 soldiers, led by our 7th Light Mechanised Brigade Combat Team which superbly led our recent response in Kosovo.All of which, makes this our largest deployment of land forces to NATO for 40 years.But NATO is only part of our rich tapestry of partnerships.And this government has taken bold decisions to embark on the partnerships we need to defend ourselves from a more dangerous world.We are rapidly building our AUKUS partnership.And last month I signed our Global Combat Air Partnership (or GCAP) with Japan and Italy.These projects are not just about building nuclear powered subs, sixth generation fighter planes, and innovating in all forms of Defence.They are about sharpening our strategic edge so we can maintain our advantage over our adversaries.They are precisely the deep relationships needed to preserve national and regional security.And they’re emblematic of the way we will work in the future.But it’s not enough to deter. We must lead. Standing up for our values around the world.And Ukraine is a test case.This year, its future may well be decided.Valiant Ukrainian warriors have had incredible success pushing back invading Russian forces, retaking 50 per cent of the territory stolen by Russia, opening up a maritime passage in the Black Sea.But the West must not let them down.British leadership has already had a galvanising effect.We’ve convened some 10 countries to help Ukrainians train here in the UK.And today I can announce that our programmes have now trained over 60,000 Ukrainian troops since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2014.Last month, I launched a new maritime coalition with Norway to defend Ukraine’s maritime flank.Since then, over 20 partner nations have joined that coalition.But the international community cannot let this support slip.Putin believes the West lacks staying power.And since the future of the world order is at stake, we must prove him wrong.Rewarding his war with victory would only increase the risk of escalation.Not only because he’s hell bent on rebuilding the Russian empire.But because it would signal weakness to other would-be aggressors.That is why on Friday the Prime Minister signed the historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation.The start of a 100-year alliance that we are building with our Ukrainian friends.It sees us increasing our military support to £2.5bn – taking the total of UK military aid to more than £7bn. With even more gifted directly from the UK’s equipment inventory.£200m will be pressed into producing and procuring thousands of drones, including surveillance and long-range strike drones.This continues the UK’s proud record as a leading donor – always being the first to get Ukraine exactly what they need.The UK was the first to provide Ukraine with weapons training, the first to provide NLAW anti-tank missiles, the first to give modern tanks, the first to send long range missiles.Now we will become the largest provider of drones too.These will be manufactured here in the UK in tandem with international partners, helping to enhance our unmanned vehicle capabilities at home too.But our new agreement with Ukraine is about so much more than money.It formalises our support in everything from intelligence sharing and cyber security to medical and military training.And it sees us taking the first giant step towards a century long partnership.Britain understands that the battle in Ukraine is existential, it proves there is no such thing as an isolated conflict.And that to shore up the international order, we must be able to act globally.So, just as we were there to help evacuate British citizens from Sudan last year, just as we are working with partners to ensure the territorial integrity of our Commonwealth ally Guyana, we have also been a critical part of the US-led international operation to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Some 15 per cent of the world’s shipping passes through these narrow shipping lanes.But the Houthis have persistently violated the law by menacing commercial vessels in the region.In the Red Sea we have seen how our brilliant Royal Navy had to act to defend itself against the intolerable and growing number of Houthi attacks.And earlier this month the world sent a very clear message to the Iranian-backed Houthis.End your illegal and unjustified actions. Stop risking innocent lives. Cease threatening the global economy.We could not have been clearer with our warnings, which they chose to ignore.And enough was enough.So last Thursday, the Prime Minister and I authorised RAF precision strikes using four RAF Typhoon FGR4s and supported by two Voyager air refuelling tankers.The result is the Houthis have been dealt a blow.Our decisive response in the Red Sea and our uplift in support for Ukraine offer a direct blueprint for how the UK must continue to lead in the future.Offering our unwavering support to our allies, and in times of struggle galvanising global responses to any malign actor seeking to break the rules based international order, and acting decisively when the moment calls for us to defend ourselves.So, deter and lead, which brings me to the final essential element of being prepared. Defending our nation.If we are to defend our homeland, we must ensure our entire defence eco-system is ready.Firstly, we must make our industry more resilient to empower us to re-arm, re-supply and innovate far faster than our opponents.There’s a huge opportunity here for British industry.The UK has long been a by-word for pioneering technologies.We gave the world radar, the jet-engine and the world wide web.We’ve not lost that spark of creativity.On the contrary, today the UK is one of only three $1 trillion tech economies.But just imagine what we could do if we managed to better harness that latent inspiration, ingenuity and invention for the Defence of our nation?Just think about the game-changing tech we could supply to our brave men and women.From the pilots ready to scramble at a moment’s notice to the soldiers protecting NATO’s flanks from Putin’s fury.To the sailors deployed across the seven seas to secure our prosperity.To our absolutely essential Royal Marine Commandos, without whom we could not properly defend our nation.To those you will never see and never know but who are out there, giving their all, on your behalf.They are the cornerstone of our defence and we owe them an unimaginable debt of gratitude.Which is why my commitment to getting them what they deserve is iron cast.After all, our greatest resource has always been the men and women who work tirelessly to protect our great nation.But to defend our nation from the increasing dangers of tomorrow, they must have what they need to do the job.That’s why this Conservative government has always and has already taken vital steps to increase defence spending, approving the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War – injecting a further £5 billion last year to replenish our stocks and modernise our nuclear enterprise.Delivering the largest cash terms defence budget ever. Spending over £50 billion on the defence of our nation.And just last week, not only maintaining our support to Ukraine but increasing it to its highest level ever.To some the costs may seem steep – but Britain cannot afford to reverse the spending gains we have made.And under this Conservative government we never will.And we will use our influence to ensure other allies and friends, faced with this new reality, and match our commitment.So, we find ourselves at the dawn of a new era. The Berlin Wall a distant memory.And we have come full circle.Moving from a post-war to a pre-war world.An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism.Today our adversaries are busily rebuilding their barriers.Old enemies are reanimated. New foes are taking shape. Battle lines are being redrawn.The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn.And the foundations of the world order are being shaken to their core.We stand at this crossroads – whether to surrender to a sea of troubles, or do everything we can to deter the danger.I believe that, in reality, it’s no choice at all.To guarantee our freedoms, we must be prepared.Prepared to deter – the enemies who are gathering all around us. Lead our allies in whatever conflicts are to come.Defend our nation whatever threat should arise. This is what Britain has always done.And it is what we must do again if we, like Margaret Thatcher speaking here 35 years ago, are once more to dream of a future without walls.",Conservative

Rishi Sunak,2024 Speech to the Ukrainian Parliament,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-speech-to-the-ukrainian-parliament/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, at the Ukrainian Rada on 12 January 2024.Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Rada…I come from the world’s oldest Parliament to address the world’s bravest.And it is an honour to do so.Every Parliamentarian serving in a democratically elected chamber treasures the ideal of freedom.Your courage is defending it.Even as the enemy came within 20 kilometres of this Chamber……with many of you personally targeted……you refused to be daunted.You continued to sit and do your duty – as you have throughout this war.Because this is where you express the sovereignty and independence……for which your people are prepared to sacrifice everything.This is where you are keeping alive the cause of democracy……in defiance of the gravest threat we have faced this century.So on behalf of Britain and all your allies:Thank you.Slava Ukraini.President Zelensky, you are an inspiration, and, Volodymyr, I am proud to call you a friend.President John F Kennedy said of the great Winston Churchill that he:“Mobilised the English language and sent it into battle.”Volodymyr, you have done the same……and English isn’t even your first language!No leader this century has done more to unite liberal democracies in the defence of our values.Thank you.Above all, let me pay tribute to the people of Ukraine.I first came to Ukraine ten years ago, in the year of the Maidan protests.I remember the sense of nervous hope……as Ukraine looked towards a future as a sovereign European democracy.And in each of my visits since this war began……even amidst all the rubble and destruction……the people I’ve met are more determined than ever to realise that dream.The soldiers who even now fight to the last breath for every inch of ground.The pilots making stunning blows against Russia’s Black Sea fleet.The gunners beating impossible odds to defend your skies.The engineers who defeated darkness during the most difficult winter in your history.And the ordinary people of Ukraine, who have endured……more than anyone should ever have to bear.Rockets and bombs deliberately aimed at homes and hospitals, shelters, and schools.Torture, rape, children kidnapped.You have met this depravity with bravery and defiance.With your unique, unbreakable Ukrainian spirit.And all of us in the free world, salute you.We meet today at a difficult moment in the struggle for Ukraine’s freedom.As always during conflict, there will be difficult moments.But we must prepare for this to be a long war.But I believe there is hope for us in the echoes of Britain’s own history.If 1940 was our finest hour…….and Ukraine’s was two years ago as you resisted the Russian invasion……then perhaps today is more like 1942.That was a point in the middle of the war……when progress on the battlefield was hard……the defence industry was under severe strain……and populations were becoming weary.It must have been hard to see the light ahead.But they stood firm.And although they did not know it then……for all the setbacks and difficulties that still lay before them……that was the moment the tide began to turn, and victory became assured.I believe that the same will be true of this moment.In the end, history tells us that democracies who endure will always prevail.Putin cannot understand……that while you can kill individuals and destroy buildings……no army can ever defeat the will of a free people.And that is why Ukraine will win.Think of what you have already achieved.Putin believed he could subjugate Ukraine by force in a matter of weeks.Instead, with every rocket he fires the Ukrainian people become ever more determined……and their sense of nationhood becomes stronger still.Russia’s military vastly outnumbers Ukrainian forces.Yet you have already regained half of the occupied territory.You have held the East, reopened vital shipping lanes to help feed the world……and increasingly made Crimea a vulnerability for Russia, not a strength.These victories show: Russia can be beaten in its war of aggression.It’s on track to lose nearly half a million men.Putin has faced an attempted coup……been indicted as an international war criminal…… presides over an economy severely weakened by sanctions……and has succeeded in persuading countries across Europe……to significantly increase their defence spending.He is now reduced to begging Iran and North Korea for weapons……and desperately sacrificing hundreds of thousands more men……in the hope that Ukraine will yield, or its friends might walk away.Well, Ukraine will not yield.And the United Kingdom will never walk away.From the very beginning……the British people spontaneously flew the Ukrainian flag – and I tell you that it flies still.They felt moved to show solidarity with people they’ve never met…In a country most have never visited…Because of our shared faith in freedom, fairness and democracy.We welcomed Ukrainian refugees with open hearts.We trained tens of thousands of their Ukrainian comrades in arms.we led the way in delivering…Helicopters, ships, tanks, and armoured vehicles…Air defences and electronic weapons systems…Planeloads of anti-tank missiles like the NLAWs and Javelins…Storm Shadows to reach behind enemy lines and defend against aggression in the Black Sea.Humanitarian and economic support.And the strongest set of sanctions ever to debilitate Russia’s economy.I’m proud that we’ve provided over £9bn of support so far.But I want to go further still.Today, President Zelensky and I agreed a new partnership between our two countries……designed to last a hundred years or more.Our partnership is about defence and security.It is about the unique ties between our people and cultures.It will build back a better and brighter future for Ukraine.To attract new investment in jobs and homes…To fund English language training for the Ukrainian people……as you make English the language of business and diplomacy.And it will hold Russia accountable for their war crimes.Because Russia must pay to rebuild what they have destroyed.Perhaps above all, it will support Ukraine to complete the historic journey you have chosen……to becoming a free, independent democracy at the heart of Europe.Ours is the unbreakable alliance:The nezlamni allianz.First, we will help you win the war.Russia thinks that they will outlast us; that our resolve is faltering.It is not.In each of the last two years, we sent you £2.3bn of military aid.This year, we are going to increase that……with the biggest single defence package so far……worth £2.5bn.This package will include:More air defence equipment, more anti-tank weapons, more long-range missiles…Thousands of rounds more ammunition and artillery shells…And training for thousands more soldiers…Now in total, the UK will have provided almost £12bn of aid to Ukraine.So be in no doubt:We are not walking away.Putin will never outlast us.We are here for Ukraine –as long as it takes.But the best way to make sure Ukraine has the weapons it needs……is to help Ukraine to produce those weapons themselves.So our second action is to work with you to massively increase defence industrial production.I believe this will be a source of huge economic strength and value for Ukraine in the future.So even as the UK donates more equipment……we will help make you the armoury of the free world.British companies like BAE Systems and AMS are already supporting your armed forces from within Ukraine.And we will go further.Starting today with £200m to manufacture thousands of new drones……both here in Ukraine and in the UK.This is the single largest package of drones given to Ukraine by any nation.Thirdly, today’s agreement supports your historic choice to join NATO.Because I believe that Ukraine’s rightful place is in NATO.But this isn’t just about how NATO benefits Ukraine.It’s about how Ukraine benefits NATO.Your understanding of modern war comes not from a textbook but the battlefield.Your armed forces are experienced, innovative, and brave.Ukraine belongs in NATO and NATO will be stronger with Ukraine.Last year’s Vilnius Summit made important steps towards membership.And I want us to be even more ambitious at the Washington Summit this June.And we made you a solemn promise……along with 30 other countries……to provide new, bilateral security assurances.Today, the UK is the first to deliver on that promise.President Zelensky and I have just signed a new security agreement.If Russia ever again invades Ukraine, the UK will come to your aid with swift and sustained security assistance.We will provide modern equipment across land, sea, and sky…Sanction Russia’s economy…And work closely with allies to do so.You will not have to ask.You will not have to argue for what you need.The UK will be there from the first moment to the last.I believe this is the greatest moment in the history of our relationship.With unprecedented security guarantees……it defines our future as allies, working together for the security of Europe……and sitting side by side among the free countries of the world.In the words of the great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko……you have broken your heavy chains and joined…The family of the freeBecause in the end, this is about even more than security.It is about Ukraine’s right as an independent nation to determine your own future.And it is about the right of all nations – enshrined in the UN Charter – to determine their own future.As Churchill said, there are two kinds of nationalism:“The craze for supreme domination by weight or force” – which he called “a danger and a vice”.Or the nationalism that comes from “love of country and readiness to die for country……love of tradition and culture……and the gradual building up…of a social entity dignified by nationhood”.He called this: “the first of virtues”.I can think of no better description of the two sides of this war.Or a better description of the battle that will define our age.Because while this war may have begun in the deluded mind……of a man in thrall to the mirage of a long-dead empire……if Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop here.That’s why President Biden, the EU, allies in NATO, the G7 and beyond……have seen the century-defining importance of this fight and they have rallied to your cause.And we cannot – and will not – falter now.Because aid to Ukraine is an investment in our own collective security.Only a Ukrainian victory will deter Putin from attacking others in the future……and prove our enemies wrong……when they say that democracies have neither the patience nor resources for long wars.This is the choice before us.These are the stakes.Waver now – and we embolden not just Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran, and elsewhere.Or rally to Ukraine’s side and defend our common cause……of democracy over dictatorship, freedom over tyranny, the rule of law over anarchy.That is what you are fighting for.And to echo Churchill:We must give you the tools – and I know that you will finish the job.Let me conclude with this final thought.On one of the earliest days of the invasion…In the darkness just before the dawn…As Russian bombs fell on Kyiv…President Zelensky stood outside the House with Chimaeras……and sent a simple, defiant message to the world:Miy tut.We are here.Today, as the world asks will your allies waver…Will our resolve weaken…Will our belief in your success falter…My reply is the same:Miy tut.We are here.As a symbol of our nezlamni allianz……I bring you today the United Kingdom’s flag……signed by our country’s entire Cabinet……to stand here until the day of your victory and beyond……as a sign to the world that we are here……and we will always be with you.Miy tut.Slava Ukraini.",Conservative

Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, on 12 January 2024.Volodymyr, thank you for the very kind honour you’ve just bestowed on me and for inviting me here today.It is an honour to stand with you……and to send a message on behalf of the United Kingdom……and indeed your allies around the world:Ukraine is not alone.And Ukraine will never be alone.Putin might think he can outlast us – but he is wrong.We stand with you today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes.Because this war is about Ukraine’s right to defend itself and determine your own future.And the Ukrainian people’s historic choice……to be an independent democracy at the heart of Europe.Your quest for freedom has inspired and moved the British people.And for the free nations of the world, aid to Ukraine is also an investment in our own collective security.Because if Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there.And our opponents around the world believe that we……have neither the patience nor resources for long wars.So waver now, and we embolden not just Putin……but his allies in North Korea, Iran, and elsewhere.That’s why the United Kingdom – and the free world – will continue to stand with Ukraine……as we have since the very beginning of this war.Judge our commitment to Ukraine’s freedom not by our words, but by our actions.The UK was the first to train Ukrainian troops.First in Europe to provide lethal weapons.First to commit western battle tanks.First to provide long-range weapons.But we need to do more.Our actions right now will determine the path of the war…So, far from our resolve faltering, the United Kingdom is announcing today……the biggest single package of defence aid to Ukraine since the war began, worth £2.5bn.This will include:More air defence equipment…More anti-tank weapons…More long-range missiles…Thousands of rounds more ammunition and artillery shells…Training for thousands more Ukrainian servicemen and women.And £200m to build thousands more drones……the single largest package of drones given to Ukraine by any nation.In total, since the war began, the UK will have provided almost £12bn of aid to Ukraine.And I’m proud that today, President Zelensky and I……have signed a new security agreement……that will form the core of a partnership between our two countries……that will last a hundred years or more.This is the first in a series of new, bilateral security assurances promised to Ukraine by 30 countries……at last year’s Vilnius Summit.And it says that if Russia ever invades Ukraine again……the UK will come to your aid with swift and sustained security assistance.We will provide modern equipment across land, sea, and sky…Sanction Russia’s economy…And work closely with allies to do so.You will not have to ask.You will not have to argue for what you need.The UK will be there from the first moment to the last.And of course, we continue to support Ukraine’s journey to NATO membership.You belong in NATO and NATO will be stronger with you.I pay tribute to all those whose significant efforts made today’s agreement happen……from the Office of the President, to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, and many others besides.President Zelensky and his team serve not only their country but the cause of peace and justice.The UK Parliament applauded your courage, resilience, and sincere love of for your country.Even at a time of war, you are reforming Ukraine for the better.And with your leadership, Ukraine will prevail.Volodymyr, the UK stands with you.I believe this is the greatest moment in the history of our relationship.It extends security guarantees from the UK to Ukraine that are unprecedented.It defines our future as allies, working together for the security of Europe.And it says that Ukraine’s place is, without doubt, among the free nations of the world.Be in no doubt:We are not walking away.Ours is the unbreakable alliance.The nezlamni allianz.And just as we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine……so those same principles guide our actions around the world.Let me say a brief word about the situation in the Red Sea.Overnight, the Royal Air Force carried out strikes against two Houthi military facilities in Yemen.I want to be very clear that these were limited strikes, carefully targeted at launch sites for drones and ballistic missiles.Over recent months, the Houthi militia have repeatedly attacked commercial ships in the Red Sea… risking innocent lives and causing huge economic disruption.In December, we launched Operation Prosperity Guardian with our allies to bolster maritime security.On 3 January, 14 counties issued a clear warning that attacks must cease.On 10 January, the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning the attacks… and highlighting the right of nations to defend their vessels and preserve the freedom of navigation.Yet the attacks have continued.British and American warships have been targeted.That’s why we’ve taken this further, limited action today… in self defence, consistent with the UN Charter.In the face of this aggression, we will always stand up for the rule of law.Thank you.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2024 Statement on Strikes Against Houthi Military Targets,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-statement-on-strikes-against-houthi-military-targets/,"The statement made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, on 12 January 2024.The Royal Air Force has carried out targeted strikes against military facilities used by Houthi rebels in Yemen.In recent months, the Houthi militia have carried out a series of dangerous and destabilising attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea, threatening UK and other international ships, causing major disruption to a vital trade route and driving up commodity prices. Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week.This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade. We have therefore taken limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence, alongside the United States with non-operational support from the Netherlands, Canada and Bahrain against targets tied to these attacks, to degrade Houthi military capabilities and protect global shipping.The Royal Navy continues to patrol the Red Sea as part of the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian to deter further Houthi aggression, and we urge them to cease their attacks and take steps to de-escalate.",Conservative

Steve Barclay,2024 Speech at the Oxford Farming Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/steve-barclay-2024-speech-at-the-oxford-farming-conference/,"The speech made by Steve Barclay, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 4 January 2024.Well, Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you, Christopher, for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be invited to join you here in Oxford today. And as someone who represents a farming constituency in a major centre for sugar beet growing in the Cambridgeshire Fens, I’m also acutely aware at this particular time of the impact that flooding on farmland is having.Indeed, my constituency has given me a strong sense of how fundamental farming is to our economy and to the environment. And in my new role as Secretary of State, I relish the opportunity of ensuring farming and food security is at the heart of government policy.Because as COVID-19 and the effects of climate change have illustrated, and indeed Tom Bradshaw just made this point on the panel, food security is fundamental to our wider national security. British farmers already produce, as colleagues in the room will already know, about 60% of the food that we eat, and I recognise and support your desire to do more. And indeed, since my first week in the job I’ve been out and about on your farms listening to how I can best support you.Based on what I’ve heard, I want to bring a clearer focus on enabling food production in our environmental land management schemes, because food production can and should go hand in hand with preserving the diversity and abundance of nature.So today, as well as updating on prices in our environmental land management schemes with an average 10% uplift to unlock more money for these schemes; and giving more choice about what you can do with more SFI actions made available to better reflect the full spectrum of farming interests; I also want to build more trust between us. Because the feedback I have received suggests too often farmers feel the regulatory bodies start from a position of suspicion rather than one of trust.Firstly, I want to respond to the important feedback many of you have provided to make sure it better pays to run a farming business by making the biggest upgrade to our farming scheme since Brexit gave us the freedom to redesign how we support agriculture. So today I’m delighted to announce new improvements to our incentives. We will pay you more for taking part in our environmental and management schemes. On average, this is an increase in rates by 10%, making it more attractive for you to get involved.Those already in schemes will automatically benefit from this uplift. And in addition, if you have a plan to pull things together in a way that makes a significant difference, you will be paid a premium for that as well. And further details are being published today. We’ll also introduce more schemes to support environmental action that underpins profits for food production by supporting SFI actions that promote healthy soil, increased pollinators and precision farming.We are making SFI simpler, including more suitable for tenant farms, with three year agreements taking on board the recommendations from Baroness rock. We have been consistently clear as a government that we will not compromise on food safety. British farmers are rightly proud of producing food that meets and often exceeds our world leading animal welfare and environmental standards. And British consumers want to buy this top-quality food. But too often products produced to lower welfare standards overseas aren’t clearly labelled to differentiate them. This is why I’m pleased to announce that we will rapidly consult on clearer labelling so we can tackle the unfairness created by misleading labelling and protect farmers and consumers.This will explore how we can better highlight imports that do not meet UK welfare standards, improve how origin information is given online, and look at how we can do even more to ensure promotional activity such as Union Jack labels on supermarket displays matches the products on the shelf. For example, this rapid consultation will address concerns such as the pork reared to lower welfare standards overseas, which is then processed in the UK and presented in supermarkets to shoppers as British. And this will include bringing lightly processed meats into the same level of labelling as unprocessed pork, and beef.We will also explore whether existing country of origin labelling rules can be strengthened by mandating how and where origin information is displayed. For example, on the front of packs, meaning farmers are fairly rewarded for meeting and often exceeding high UK welfare standards. And indeed, this reflects the lessons from labelling on eggs, where informed consumer choice has driven changes in consumer purchasing with the number of free-range eggs more than doubling. The hard work and dedication of farmers, fishers and food producers makes this country competitive globally – the English sparkling wine, the Scottish smoked salmon and whiskey, the Welsh lamb, the Northern Ireland beef. And it all gets a massive vote of confidence from consumers around the world to the tune, in fact, of around 24 billion in exports for the British economy.So, I am delighted that from the start of this year all geographical indication products made and sold in Great Britain will be using our UK GI logo, which protects the geographical names of food and drink. UK producers will also be able to use this logo on products sold abroad, which will help even more of your product stand out from the crowd both at home and overseas.And we have also recruited agri-food attaches linked to our embassy network to open up more markets in line with the commitments we gave at the farm to fork Summit. These attaches have already opened up new markets such as poultry to Tunisia and pork to Chile. I also want the public sector to procure more high quality, sustainable food produced by you, and Parliament has in fact recently passed legislation following our exit from the European Union which enables a greater emphasis on the public benefits of this public sector procurement.We will also update the government buying standards for food and catering to emphasise the importance of buying food with high environmental and welfare standards, which will play to the strengths of our food producers. Now, improving productivity is also key to boosting food production. And we have world leading agri-tech innovators here in the UK. Having listened to farmers, I am keen to focus more on technology that can be bought now as opposed to prioritising early stage research. Later this month, I will be inviting farmers to apply for share of an initial £15 million for innovations, like robotic mechanical weeding technology, that can be implemented right away. And more grants will be launched this year to help you grow more, sell more and make your businesses more sustainable and resilient for the future.Now I know that even with these grants, some farmers still find it hard to find the capital to make use of the grants that are available. So we will also look at ways to make them even easier to access. And to attract the ambitious and diverse future workforce that we need we will continue to support the Institute for Agriculture and Horticulture. And this is all part of how we are ensuring we meet our commitment to invest every pound of the full farming budget.Next, I want to give farming businesses more choice. So today I’m pleased to announce around 50 new actions are being added to our environmental land management schemes, many of which support food production, for farmers to choose what is right for them whether you farm on grassland, moorland, or riverbanks, making it easier for our support to fit into your business plans. These new actions embrace innovations from soil health to precision farming, to robotics. And they also recognise that there is scope to streamline the application process for schemes. And we have already started to put that into practice. So now you can apply for the sustainable farming incentive and the countryside stewardship mid tier together through one single application, meaning you’ll have the same actions and can have the same ambition just with less paperwork. And I’m keen to work with you to streamline paperwork further. Part of offering more choice is also about improving permitted development rights. And that’s why I’m working with government colleagues following the recent consultation and exploring how we can reduce the barriers faced by farm development projects that have become all too familiar in the conversations I’ve been having with farmers.What I’ve also heard frequently from farmers is that you feel the starting point for too many interactions with regulatory bodies is one way you are treated with suspicion and not trust. In my experience, no one cares more about the land, the nature around them, or the passing of their farm to future generations in good health than the farmers who are the custodians of that land. So the relationship from government and regulatory bodies should better reflect this. As Secretary of State I have asked officials to work as a priority with the Rural Payments Agency, Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency to review the interactions between you and their staff. As the report a few weeks ago from David Fursdon showed regarding Natural England, there are lessons to be learned in the relationship with those who manage and care for the land which I am keen to ensure are heeded.Lastly, in respect of TB, I want to recognise the terrible toll this takes on those who raise cattle. In contrast to Wales, our policy in England has worked in reducing cases and we remain focused on eradication. Informed by the science and the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer, our approach has included culling options, and we will continue with that going forward.So to conclude, I recognise for a successful farming sector, we need to support food production and improve farm productivity. That is why today I’m increasing the SFI payment rates on average by 10%, expanding the SFI actions and committing to build on the streamlining of applications. I look forward to working with you on a rapid consultation on labelling to better reflect the high standards of British farmers and empower consumers, leverage public sector procurement and expand our export potential. And I want to ensure government and regulatory bodies are more responsive to your diverse needs. Reflecting that you are the custodians of the land that you care for. More money, more choice, more trust. That is my approach to putting farmers at the heart of government policy, working with you to promote food production as part of a shared commitment. to economic growth. Thank you very much.",Conservative
Keir Starmer,2024 Keynote New Year’s Speech,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/keir-starmer-2024-keynote-new-years-speech/,"The speech made by Keir Starmer, the Leader of the Opposition, on 4 January 2024.Thank you Claire, you will be a great candidate for Filton and Bradley Stoke, and in time I hope, an even better MP.And it’s great to be here again looking at the next generation of aircraft wings. You can see some of the instruments behind me. This is the third time and I love it, and it features quite heavily in a number of my speeches.On behalf of the Labour Party – thank you for being here this morning and Happy New Year.Now – as a politician, you’ve got to be a bit careful with these new year messages.We all remember Boris Johnson’s prediction of a “fantastic year ahead”. That was in 2020.Then, last year, I stuck my neck out and occasionally predicted glory for Arsenal, so I’ll pass on that one today.But look, there is one thing that we can be sure is coming this year and I’m ready for it. The thought of millions of people, right across our country, putting a cross on that ballot paper.It’s what we’ve been waiting for, preparing for, fighting for. A year of choice.A chance to change Britain. A clock that is ticking on this government, because whether it’s in the spring or later in the year, the moment when power is taken out of Tory hands and given, not to me, but to you. That moment is getting closer by the second.So, if you’ve spent the last 14 years volunteering to keep your park clean, your library open, for children to have opportunities. If you’ve been breaking your back to keep trading, steering your business through the pandemic, the cost-of-living crisis, the challenge of Brexit and the chaos of Westminster. If you’ve been serving our country, whether in scrubs or the uniform of your regiment, and what you want now is a politics that serves you – then make no mistake, this is your year. The opportunity to shape our country’s future rests in your hands.And that is a new year message of hope. The hope of democracy. The power of the vote. The potential for national renewal. The chance, finally, to turn the page, lift the weight off our shoulders, unite as a country, and get our future back.Four years, I’ve been working for this. Four years, working for the chance to tilt this country, firmly and decisively, back towards the interests of working people.It’s been a long, hard slog, and I won’t lie, I’ve hated the futility of opposition.The powerlessness and yes, the pain, that comes from watching the Tories drive the country I love into the rocks of decline.I didn’t come into politics for that. I didn’t expect a front row seat on this Tory performance art, a song and dance for your political attention, because they find performing so much easier than the hard graft of practical achievement.No. I came into politics to serve, to get things done, to strive, each and every day, to make a difference to the lives of working people, that’s what gets me up in the morning.And if you can put aside the reality of Westminster just for a moment, it’s why I still believe in politics.I had a long career before this: at the Crown Prosecution Service, as a human rights lawyer, in my work with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I’ve looked into the eyes of people I’ve served and represented, and I have seen reflected back the knowledge that government can make or break a life.Literally, when it comes to work I’ve done with people on death row. Life and death decisions, in your hands.Now there’s pressure that comes with that, of course there is. But that’s the responsibility of justice and public service, and it’s the responsibility of serious government.This isn’t a game. Politics shouldn’t be a hobby – a pastime for people who enjoy the feeling of power. And nor should it be a sermon from on high, a self-regarding lecture, vanity dressed up as virtue.No, it should be a higher calling. The power of the vote. The hope of change and renewal, married to the responsibility of service, that’s what I believe in.And yes, I believe it’s still the best way to change our country for the better.Its success or failure, written into the walls of every community in this country.The hospital your children were born in, the home you live in, the wage in your pocket, the opportunities in your town, the sense of pride – or unease – when you walk down your street. That’s all politics.So, this year, at the General Election, against the tide of cynicism in Westminster, the gauntlet of fear the Tories will unleash, and most of all – the understandable despair of a downtrodden country, I will ask the British people to believe in it again.I will say, you’re right to be anti-Westminster, right to be angry about what politics has become. But hold on to the flickering hope in your heart that things can be better, because they can.You can choose it. You can choose the hope of national renewal, the responsibility of service, what politics can and should be, and you can reject the pointless populist gestures, and the low-road cynicism that the Tories believe is all you deserve.That’s all they’ve got left now, after 14 years, with nothing good to show, no practical achievements to point towards, no purpose beyond the fight to save their own skins, this is their only project.They can’t change Britain, so they will try to undermine the possibility of change itself. Take Britain down to their level, kick the hope out of us all.But I believe in this country, I believe in its spirit, I believe in its people, in its businesses, in its communities, and most of all, I believe that if the British people see respect and service in their politics – if they see a plan which matches the ambition and pride they have for their community, a path, finally, to an economy that rewards and respects their efforts – then yes, they will commit to the mission of national renewal, and will believe that Britain can get its future back.But I am under no illusions. This is a huge test. We’re trying not just to defeat the Tories, but to defeat their entire way of doing politics, a mindset that seeks out any differences between the people of this country, and, like weeds between the paving stones, will pull apart the cracks, so ultimately, they can divide and rule.I have to warn you all, they will leave no stone unturned this year. Every opportunity for division will be exploited for political potential. That’s a given. But do not doubt for a second that we’re ready for it, do not doubt that we will show the British people that the real risk is five more years of a Tory Government that would be even more entitled, even more self-serving, even more complacent that your vote can be taken for granted.And yet, at the same time, we have to bring the country together, have to earn trust as well as votes, nurture a spirit of national unity. This is what’s distinctive about our job this year. To truly defeat this miserabilist Tory project, we must crush their politics of divide and decline with a new Project Hope.Not a grandiose utopian hope. Not the hope of the easy answer, the quick fix, or the miracle cure. People have had their fill of that from politicians over the past 14 years.No – they need credible hope, a frank hope, a hope that levels with you about the hard road ahead, but which shows you a way through, a light at the end of the tunnel. The hope of a certain destination.That’s why the national missions we’ve set, the measurable goals. Whether it’s the highest growth in the G7, halving violence against women and girls, clean power by 2030 – they are unapologetically ambitious.I know they will take hard-work, determination, patience – a true national effort. And for many people that invites a sharp intake of breath, a raised eyebrow, a question – can this really be done?But look, what really keeps me up at night is a different reaction altogether, the biggest challenge we face – bar none. The shrug of the shoulder.Because this is the paradox of British politics right now. Everyone agrees we are in a huge mess. Services on their knees, an economy that doesn’t work for working people even when it grows, let alone now when it stagnates like right now.Everyone agrees as well – that it’s been like this for a while. That Britain needs change, wants change, is crying out for change. And yet, trust in politics is now so low, so degraded, that nobody believes you can make a difference anymore.Also, that after the sex scandals, the expenses scandals, the waste scandals, the contracts for friends, even in a crisis like the pandemic, some people have looked at us and concluded we’re all just in it for ourselves.A nation that is so exhausted, tired, despairing even, that they’ve given up on hope. A national mood which, if we aren’t successful with our Project Hope, the Tories will subtly seek to exploit.Seriously, after failing to deliver change, after ludicrously pretending that they could represent change, they now sense the opportunity of a new strategy, an attempt to take the change option off the table altogether.And not just at the next election. No – their strategy also has one eye on salting the earth of Britain’s future, a plan to make sure that if Labour does earn the right to serve, we will find it harder to bring our country together for the common good.So I say to every voter in this country: know that all this is coming your way. Know that if we are to heal the wounds of the past 14 years and move forward, Britain must come together.And that means we will need you. But also know that whether you’re thinking of voting Labour for the first time, whether you always vote Labour, or whether you have no intention of voting Labour whatsoever, my party will serve you.That’s who we are now. A changed party. No longer in thrall to gesture politics, no longer a party of protest, a party of service.Rebuilt, renewed, reconnected to an old partnership, a Labour partnership, that we serve working people as they drive Britain forward.So this is what I promise – my side of the deal, the answer to the question why Labour?I promise a new purpose. To drag politics in this country back to service, tilt our economy back towards the interests of working people. Reward their efforts fairly, once again.I promise a new plan with new priorities, five national missions that will sweep away the era of Tory division, a plan for the long-term.With higher growth, a reformed planning system no longer blocking the homes, infrastructure and investment we need.Safer streets, more police in your town, cracking down on anti-social behaviour.Cheaper bills, with GB Energy, a new public company, using clean British power not foreign oil and gas.More opportunities for your children, new technical excellence colleges training our kids in the skills they need and businesses want.Better mental health support in schools, expert teachers in every classroom, paid for – by removing tax breaks on private schools.And our NHS back on its feet, with a plan to cut the waiting lists, paid for by removing the non-dom tax status. Two million more appointments every year in an NHS clearing the backlog, seven days a week.And written through this new plan, I also promise this: a total overhaul in how we approach the economy and government.On government, it means a new level of ambition and focus. I ran a public service for years and the clue is in that word – service.What the Tories have done to our public realm over the last 14 years, not just the cuts, also the denigration of the people who serve this country, the total lack of respect, honestly there are no words.But I also have to say this, I don’t see our job as going back to some kind of golden age, I don’t think that’s how working people look at things at all. Government in this country is too centralised and controlling, and because of that, too disconnected from the communities it needs to serve.And yet despite hoarding all that power, it also lacks ambition. A view of the potential of government that is content just to mop up problems, after the fact, armed only with a big state cheque-book.We have got to change this. It is vital for taking on the profound challenges of our era: the rising geopolitical temperature, climate change, terrorism, securing our borders, the revolutions in science, energy, technology that are reshaping everything we know about our world.So I promise this: a new mindset – Mission Government. An understanding at the core of everything we do, that it is our job to tackle tomorrow’s challenges – today.On the economy it means a deeper argument about who growth should serve, where it comes from, who it comes from, where is the great untapped potential?And the answer to every one of those questions, the Labour answer, working people. Communities casually ignored and disregarded, passed over as sources of economic dynamism, subjected to the Tory argument that thinks growth comes from driving down their wages and security, while they, in turn, should be grateful for anything handed down from those at the top.I’ve read that the Tories want to fight the election on this terrain, that they think their economic comfort zone still has some purchase.But let me tell you, what used to be their strength is now their weakness. The so-called party of business which now hates business, that boasts about tax cuts, while raising taxes higher than any time since the war, that claim, even now, to be the party of sound finance, but that crashed the economy and made you pay.They have nothing left on this anymore. Their credit rating is zero, and we have turned the tables with a plan for the growth Britain needs.Only Labour will deliver a proper industrial policy and higher investment.Only Labour will bulldoze through planning red tape and get Britain building.Only Labour will transform our labour market with stronger workers’ rights.We don’t just expect an election on the economy, we want an election on the economy, we’re ready for that fight, ready to close the book on their trickle-down nonsense, once and for all.And finally, I promise this. A determination to bring our country together, not exploit its divisions. An understanding that Britain’s standing in the world can never be taken for granted, and a politics of respect and service that shows zero tolerance towards the darker side of Westminster.Don’t get me wrong, there are good people in Westminster. People who love their country and want to change it for the better. And yet a basic principle of any organisation I’ve worked in outside of politics, that you should follow the rules you set for others, uphold the values you advocate, this just doesn’t seem to be followed or understood in Westminster.Honestly, what does anybody think it looks like to the people of this country, to see people rewarded, honoured, for crashing the economy under Liz Truss?If your mortgage is going up this year and you see those people swanning around the House of Lords, what do you think?No. I say to all my fellow politicians – Labour and Tory – to change Britain, we must change ourselves.We need to clean up politics. No more VIP fast lanes. No more kickbacks for colleagues. No more revolving doors between Government and the companies they regulate. I will restore standards in public life with a total crackdown on cronyism.I’ve put expense cheat politicians in jail before and I didn’t care if they were Labour or Tory.And I grew up working class, so spare me the self-serving excuses, they just won’t wash. This ends now. Nobody will be above the law in a Britain I lead.But with respect and service I also promise this: a politics that treads a little lighter on all of our lives.Because that’s the thing about populism, or nationalism, any politics fuelled by division.It needs your full attention. It needs you constantly focusing on this week’s common enemy. And that’s exhausting, isn’t it?On the other hand, a politics that aspires to national unity, bringing people together, the common good, that’s harder to express, less colourful, fewer clicks on social media. And, in some ways, it’s more demanding of you.It asks you to moderate your political wishes out of respect for the different wishes of others. 45 million voters can’t get everything that they want, that’s democracy.So no matter the road the Tories take this year, I believe that if people see the commitment to service is always there in politics. If they can see that people in power respect their concerns, then I think a lot of people across this country, after everything we’ve been through in the past 14 years, will find some hope in that.It will feel different, frankly. The character of politics will change, and with it the national mood. A collective breathing out. A burden lifted. And then, the space for a more hopeful look forward.Because the truth is, it’s this kind of politics and only this kind of politics that can offer real change. The energy needed for divisive politics is a distraction. You can see that with the SNP in Scotland or the Tories here in England.I learnt this first-hand in Northern Ireland. Before the Police Service of Northern Ireland was set-up, the idea that the nationalist community would buy into it in any way was utterly unthinkable.Now, there’s always more work to do on that, peace in Northern Ireland has to be won every day. And yet, with patient listening, with determination, with the people of Northern Ireland coming together, not only with those different to them.Not only with those who disagreed with them, but who even took up arms against the, the unthinkable happened. Catholic men and women did step-up to serve.So don’t listen to the siren voices that say we can’t change Britain. We can, and we will. Don’t listen when they say we’re all the same. We’re not, and we never will be. And don’t listen when they say politics makes no difference – because it does.If you can’t get an affordable home in your town, but with Labour you can, that’s a difference worth fighting for.If you can’t get a job with regular hours that will let you look after your family but with Labour you can, that’s a difference worth fighting for.If you’re a care worker who saved lives during the pandemic and has been rewarded with poverty wages, but with Labour you can get a fair pay agreement, that’s a difference worth fighting for.The same is true for our NHS. For our schools, climate change and energy security, securing our borders, restoring Britain’s standing, crime and justice.Only Labour will make a difference.Only Labour will drag our politics back to service.Only Labour can lead Britain towards national renewal.And you have the power to vote for it.A party of service with a plan, versus a party with nothing to offer because it only cares about itself?Hope or cynicism?A new politics or the same old Westminster? Continued decline with the Tories, or national renewal with Labour?Nobody in Britain thinks the years ahead will be easy. But this year is the chance, the only chance, to change our course.The future of Britain in your hands, the power of the vote in your control, and we will fight every day to earn it.Why Labour? Because we serve your interests.Why Labour? Because we will grow every corner of our country.Why Labour? Because we have a plan to take back our streets, switch on Great British Energy, get the NHS back on its feet, tear down the barriers to opportunity, and get Britain building again.A partnership with you in pursuit of a new Britain with foundations built to last.The value of hard work – restored.Sticking plasters – rejected.The Tory era of division – over.A Britain standing tall again, looking forward again, believing again, that tomorrow will be better for your children.That is our future. And this year, we get it back.Thank you.",Labour

Alister Jack,2024 New Year’s Message,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/alister-jack-2024-new-years-message/,"The message issued by Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, on 30 December 2023.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack looks back on 2023 and ahead to 2024.As another New Year dawns, I’d like to pass on my best wishes for 2024 to my fellow Scots at home and abroad.As we get ready to make our resolutions for the year to come, it is also time to take stock of the departing 12 months.Looking back, we have worked hard on our mission to level up communities across Scotland.Creating equality of opportunity for all – regardless of background – has been our ambition. Our levelling up initiatives are doing this by helping people and their neighbourhoods flourish.Listening to local communities – and working closely with the Scottish Government and councils – is bearing fruit on our investments.In 2023 we broke through the £2.9 billion barrier when it comes to UK Government levelling-up investment in Scotland.Among the highlights of the last 12 months have been the creation of two Freeports with a UK Government investment of £26 million each, one on the Firth of Forth and the other on the Cromarty Firth.These were followed by the establishment of two Investment Zones in Glasgow and the North East, both of which are benefitting from up to £160 million each from the UK Treasury.Businesses in these areas will get special tax breaks and other support to help them flourish and create jobs.Seven Scottish towns are receiving £20 million each as part of our Towns Fund. Levelling Up Partnerships have also been set up which will result in Dundee, the Western Isles, Argyll and Bute and Dumfries and Galloway receiving £20 million each. This funding will help transform these communities, boosting investment and jobs.And 2023 saw the announcement of two further rounds of the Levelling Up Fund, which will pay for multi-million-pound community investment right across Scotland.Along with my ministerial colleagues in the Scotland Office, Malcolm Offord and John Lamont, it has been great to visit many of these projects and see for ourselves the difference they are making.Reflecting on 2023, it would be remiss of me not to mention the Scottish Government’s Gender Recognition Reform legislation. The decision to issue a Section 35 Order for the first time in the history of devolution was not one which I took lightly. But when faced with proposals that would have an adverse impact on reserved equalities legislation I felt there was little option other than to act. I strongly believe the comprehensive judgement issued by Lady Haldane in the UK Government’s favour entirely justifies this stance.Scotland is famous across the world for our culture and sport. We were delighted to contribute to the arts scene by contributing almost £9 million to the world-famous Edinburgh festivals.I was thrilled that Scotland’s men’s team qualified for next year’s European Championships. It was a pleasure to welcome Steve Clarke to Dover House when we hosted a reception marking the 150th anniversary of the Scottish Football Association. Like all Scotland fans I’m tremendously excited by the thought of our team going to Germany in 2024.A highlight of 2023 for so many was the Coronation of King Charles III. As Scottish Secretary I was greatly honoured to play a small part in an uplifting and moving ceremony which marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the United Kingdom.I know that for many people the last few years have been extremely difficult. We are still feeling the impact of the Covid pandemic and Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine has put pressure on our economy. Under the leadership of Rishi Sunak, the UK Government has made great strides in bringing inflation down. And just as the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury provided unprecedented support during Covid, we have provided unprecedented financial help to tackle the cost of living crisis. Our £105 billion funding package is providing each household with an average of £3,700 in support.By working together as one United Kingdom we can withstand the challenges the coming months and years throw at us.And, looking ahead to 2024, my resolution is to keep working to bring more prosperity and jobs to Scotland. With that in mind, I’m looking forward to the opening of the Perth Museum, backed by £10 million from the UK Government and which will be a splendid new home for the Stone of Scone.We will also see the signing of the full growth deals for Falkirk and Argyll and Bute, partnerships in which we will invest £40 million and £25 million respectively. And yet more money for community projects as we continue our levelling up mission.Happy New Year.Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2024 New Year’s Message,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2024-new-years-message/,"The message issued by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, on 31 December 2023.Happy New Year, everyone. I hope you had a great Christmas.We can look back on a pretty momentous year. We’ve delivered record funding for the NHS and social care. Schools in England are surging up the global league tables.We’re getting the economy growing. We’ve cut inflation in half. We’ve delivered the biggest business tax cut in modern British history.And in just the last few weeks, we’ve seen an incredible £60 billion of investment into the UK. So my New Year’s resolution is to keep driving forward. In six days’ time, we’ll deliver a tax cut for 27 million people, worth on average £450.Inflation is set to fall further, cutting the cost of living for everyone. And we’re not stopping there.We’re going further to grow our economy by reducing debt, cutting taxes, and rewarding hard work, building secure supplies of energy here at home, backing British business and delivering world class education. And we’re taking decisive action to stop the boats and break the business model of the criminal gangs.From our incredible armed forces and NHS staff who take care of all of us. To our tech experts, scientists and innovators who are putting our economy at the global cutting edge.We should look forward full of pride and optimism for what we can do together to build a brighter future for everyone. That’s what I’m determined to do, and I wish you all a very happy 2024.",Conservative

Oliver Dowden,2023 Speech on AI in Government,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/oliver-dowden-2023-speech-on-ai-in-government/,"The speech made by Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister, on 20 December 2023.It’s great to be here, opening this sell-out event, and that was even before I was confirmed as a speaker.It is one of the biggest hands-on technical upskilling events the government has ever hosted.A historic event – and this is a historic moment in human history.Because artificial intelligence is changing everything – the way we live and the way we work.A big focus of the government has been on making sure those technologies are safe.Many of you were involved in delivering the world’s first ever AI Safety Summit, which took place at Bletchley Park earlier this month.But as well as the huge risks AI poses, there are also enormous opportunities – particularly for us in the public sector to transform productivity.As the Chancellor said at the weekend, some public servants waste a whole working day each week on admin.I’ve worked in government for many years and I know the frustrations.You just want to get on with your work – but it isn’t that easy.Stifled by systems.Bogged down by bureaucracy.Peed off by processes that haven’t changed in decades.No wonder, as Jim Hacker says in Yes Minister, “it takes time [for the civil service] to do things quickly” and “it’s more expensive to do things cheaply”.Well, all that can change – with the help of AI.The potential productivity benefits from applying these technologies to routine tasks across the public sector are estimated to be worth billions.The UK is already leading the way: ranked third in the Government AI Readiness Index and attracting £18 billion of private investment since 2016.Traditionally, though, the public sector has not been the fastest adopter.But with AI it doesn’t have to be that way.We have the big data.We have the large workforce.We have the finest minds and the keenest beans and a government which is one hundred per cent behind this, driven by our Prime Minister.So many sectors are embracing the opportunities and the benefits are being felt across society.90 per cent of stroke units are now using cutting-edge AI tools.Thousands of teachers have signed up to a pilot AI-powered lesson planner and quiz builder.We’re bringing that spirit to Whitehall.We’ve got civil servants upskilling through this One Big Thing initiative.Earlier this month I announced we were trialling AI red boxes to reduce paperwork. An idea that sprung from an Evidence House hackathon which many of you in this room took part in.And today I can unveil plans for a new, turbo-charged, ‘Incubator for AI’ team.Job adverts go live today – on our new website – ai.gov.uk – to boost this team to an initial 30 people technical AI experts, programme managers, product managers and engagement specialists all working together to rapidly enhance the adoption of AI through a centre of excellence.One of their first tasks will be to assess which Government systems have data curated in the right way to take advantage of AI and which systems need updating before that full potential can be harnessed.I think of the potential of this work, from correspondence to call handling, from health care to welfare.I don’t mean replacing real people with robots, or adding to the frustrations of dealing with government.I mean removing the things that annoy people most in their dealings with officialdom – namely the time it takes to do things quickly.Imagine that transformation from computer says no, to computer says yes.And we can all be part of that – we all deal with digital and data in some way or another.So let us, the civil service, be the early adopters.Let us be the trailblazers.Let Whitehall show the country – and the world – how it’s done.The revolution has just begun.Thank you.",Conservative
Chris Heaton-Harris,2023 Statement at Hillsborough Castle,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/chris-heaton-harris-2023-statement-at-hillsborough-castle/,"The statement made by Chris Heaton-Harris at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland on 20 December 2023.Over the last number of days my team and I have been meeting the main parties in Northern Ireland to discuss how we can financially support a restored executive.On behalf of the United Kingdom Government, last week I presented a significant package which sets the executive up for success.We asked the parties for their views and we have listened.Following a lot of discussions over the weekend and over the last few days this morning I brought forward a new plan that reasonably and generously responds to the parties concerns and provides Northern Ireland Ministers with an offer for a restored executive worth in excess of £3bn.This package provides solutions to many of the issues the parties have raised.The parties have asked for a new formula for deciding how much Northern Ireland receives from the UK Government. We have agreed to establish such a model reflecting the different levels of need in Northern Ireland. That would see funding uplifted through the Barnett Formula by 24% from 2024-2025.The parties have asked for assistance with public sector pay; this package includes £584m to address this.The parties asked for money to stabilise Northern Ireland’s public services. We have made available more than £1bn for them to do this.The parties have raised concerns about their existing debt. Now I’ve been clear that we will be prepared to take steps to address those concerns of the Northern Ireland Executive if the Northern Ireland Executive publishes and implements a plan to deliver sustainable public finances and services.On top of that, the UK Government has committed more than £30m to immediately start tackling health waiting lists and indeed following the PSNI data breach we have granted an initial reserve claim of £15m which would not need to be repaid.And, we have offered to create an enhanced investment zone in Northern Ireland worth over £150m.It is disappointing that there will not be a new executive up and running to take up this offer and deliver it for the people of Northern Ireland before Christmas. However, this package is on the table and will remain there, available on day one of an incoming Northern Ireland Executive to take up.This is a generous package but like any government, an incoming executive will have to make decisions on its priorities going forward. That will need to include, as part of this offer, increasing the revenue the executive raises through its own powers.The UK Government has also held extensive talks with the Democratic Unionist Party on the Windsor Framework over the last eight months. I’d like to thank the DUP and its leadership for the way they’ve engaged constructively in those talks. In particular, the Government has sought to address the specific concerns raised by the DUP prior to and during these negotiations.From our perspective, those talks on all the issues of substance have reached a conclusion.We stand ready to introduce a package of measures that have been worked on together should the DUP reach a decision to proceed.I have always believed that Northern Ireland is best governed by locally elected and accountable MLAs. They can use the financial package and put in place the policies that will transform public services for the better of everyone across the whole of Northern Ireland and there is before us a great opportunity for the parties to return to governing on behalf of the people who elected them.The financial package that is now before the parties would set Northern Ireland on a sustainable footing with a bright future ahead.So to end, these financial talks have concluded and there is a financial package worth an excess of £3bn on the table should the executive be restored. From our perspective the Windsor Framework talks on all issues of substance have effectively concluded but we’re always, always happy to answer concerns and any questions on these.The UK Government also stands ready to deliver on the outcomes of the Windsor Framework talks when the institutions are restored.It is now time for decisions to be made.",Conservative

We were at the forefront of providing military and humanitarian aid to the Ukrainian people.When it mattered, the UK stepped up to the plate.In turn, this support has been recognised by the Ukrainian people, who dubbed the UK ‘Ukraine’s best friend’.However, since the very start, we have also recognised that we cannot rely on military force alone.Time and again, history has shown us that when economies fail, so do tyrants.That is why, together with our allies, we have imposed the most severe sanctions Russia has ever faced in its history……targeting more than 1,900 individuals and entities and 19 Russian banks with global assets of £940 billion.…effectively weaponising the Ruble and providing the financial punch to send Putin and his ambitions reeling.Sanctions are an important tool in our diplomatic arsenal that allow us to respond to global threats not just with words but backed up with actions.We estimate that without combined sanctions Russia would have over $400 billion more to fund its war machine.We’ve used them not only to weaken Putin’s war efforts, but also to showcase our unyielding support for Ukraine, to deter corrupt activity and cyber-attacks and to demonstrate our condemnation of international human rights violations and abuses.We also want to make sure that we respond to wider HMG international priorities, such as the threat of climate change- we can’t do that without engaging with countries at events like COP28 – so our trade sanctions work must be consistent, clear and boundaried to make diplomatic relations on other fora as constructive as possible.My department, DBT, has played a significant part in this work, developing trade sanctions that have had a £20 billion impact on the Russian economy…including by barring Russian businesses from benefitting from our world -renowned services sector.Thanks to these measures, imports to the UK from Russia have fallen by 94% since the start of the conflict. While UK goods exports have plunged by 74% and services exports have fallen by 50%. Make no mistake these measures are working.Step by step the sanctions imposed by the UK and its allies are destroying Russia’s ability to maintain, upgrade, and modernise its economy.…placing a chokehold on investment and productivity – the building blocks of the war machine – which means while Ukraine’s military equipment is improving, Russia’s is degrading.Of course, the UK has used sanctions before – but never on this scale or scope or with this level of urgency.As a result, we’ve become ever swifter and more capable at imposing such measures.But we know we can’t be complacent. We need to stay ahead of those who dream up tricks to swerve sanctions or create workarounds.Having one of the most robust sanctions regimes in the world is not good enough if we cannot have absolute, unwavering confidence that our rules are being enforced and that no one is exploiting loopholes in the system.That is why we recently carried out a cross-government review of how we implement and enforce sanctions, which highlighted areas where we can do more.For instance, we need an expanded toolkit of enforcement powers for trade sanctions breaches – just as we have for financial sanctions.These additional civil enforcement powers will complement HMRC’s existing – and continuing – powers to take forward criminal prosecutions.That expanded enforcement toolkit will also be crucial to our efforts – working in lock-step with our international allies – to clamp down on trade via third countries to Russia. These powers will allow us to act where there is a UK national or a UK registered company involved.And internationally, we are working closely with US and EU sanctions coordinators to liaise with several third party countries to highlight the risks of circumnavigating trade sanctions and together to support them to enforce sanctions effectively.This has included joint diplomatic outreach to countries where we are seeing spikes in trade of sanctioned goods with Russia.For example, in recent months, we have sent joint delegations to countries like Kazakhstan, UAE and Uzbekistan, to highlight these risks… I have personally recently been to Kazakhstan and Mongolia and seen for myself the challenges we face.But our coordinated efforts are paying off. A number of countries – including Turkey, Kazakhstan and Armenia– have announced concrete measures to reduce the risk of sanctioned goods reaching Russia.So, you can see how it is critical that we act.Today I am proud to say that this is exactly what we are doing, with the creation of the Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation, or for short called OTSI.The Office will build up our trade sanctions capability and make sure our sanctions regimes are as impactful as possible.It will also crack down on companies that breach trade sanctions and so help to facilitate warmongers and tyrants to cling to power. Its remit will include the civil enforcement of trade sanctions, as well as providing guidance to business and supporting compliance.We expect the Office to be ready to enforce trade sanctions next year once its new legal powers are in force.Today’s announcement came from listening to business asking what more they need to know to get it right.Most have been exemplary in their response to Russia’s invasion, experiencing the sometimes painful financial consequences of complying with these sanctions to stand up to Putin’s tyranny.But we do recognise the scale and pace of sanctions-work has been challenging at times. The new office will do more to clarify our expectations and lend support to businesses, ensuring those who play by the rules won’t lose out to those companies that just don’t.That is where OTSI will come into its own.But we will also need business expertise, guidance and input to make sure the new unit is as effective and as impactful as possible.In terms of its functions and responsibilities, OTSI will lead on the civil enforcement of trade sanctions. It will have a range of enforcement tools available including levying monetary penalties on those that break the rules and sanctions dodgers.And while OTSI will sit within the Department for Business and Trade, its work will complement the work of other government departments and offices responsible for the implementation and enforcement of other sanctions regimes.This includes the Treasury’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, which remains responsible for financial sanctions.The Department for Transport, which remains responsible for transport sanctions. And the Home Office which is responsible for immigration sanctions and for Modern Slavery.In addition, overall leadership of sanctions policy will continue to sit with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.OTSI is key in the Government’s delivery of its Economic Deterrence Initiative, announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year in the Integrated Review Refresh.This Initiative is focused on strengthening our tools to deter potential aggressors and stop them in their tracks.One of the key objectives of this Initiative is building expertise across government in the design, implementation, and enforcement of sanctions, as they achieve maximum impact.The new office will better support the implementation and enforcement of all trade sanctions regimes – not just in terms of Russia but for rogue regimes right across the world.In fact, Parliament will soon be considering the Government’s latest trade sanctions package, which includes further export and import bans and financial restrictions for Russia.Crucially, this new package will also ban the export of a range of goods including the latest items Ukraine has encountered on the battlefield such as machine parts and chemicals, as well as products that raise revenue to fund Putin’s war machine.In essence, once this legislation is passed only low-risk, humanitarian, food, and health exports to Russia will remain unsanctioned.And there is more to come.The UK remains committed to upholding the rule of law, which protects global security and human dignity in all parts of the world, especially the most vulnerable.We are more united than ever in the pursuit of international peace, prosperity and sustainable development, and have strengthened our engagement with international partners beyond the G7We’ve seen how well sanctions can work and we’re getting even better at using them.That’s why I’ve no doubt that the Office of Trade and Sanctions Implementation will be a game-changer for the UK on the international stage, allowing us to move in lock-step with our allies on economic sanctions as they’re needed.Sanctions are crafted to be targeted and focused to have maximum impact – we’ve used them to disrupt all avenues for Putin to pay for his illegal war.OTSI will also be a game changer for British businesses at home where my department will help in building stronger international supply chains which are not dependent on malevolent foreign actors.On Wednesday I’m hoping to launch my Critical Minerals imports supply chain paper to help businesses too.In turn, this will translate into the prosperity and security that will benefit our citizens long into the future.I’m really grateful to policy exchange for allowing me the moment today to launch OTSI, and I look forward to working with all of you especially if you’re a business so we can develop this work moving forward. Thank you so much.",Conservative
David Cameron,2023 Speech on Human Rights Day,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2023-speech-on-human-rights-day/,"The speech made by David Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, in London on 7 December 2023.Thank you for joining us in marking Human Rights Day.75 years ago, in the aftermath of the horrors of the Second World War, the world declared that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. A universal entitlement. A simple truth. An historic step.Tragically today, that principle is under growing threat. Autocracy rising again. New tech misused. Individual freedoms violated and abused.I therefore make three commitments to you today.First, the UK will continue to stand up for the rights of all.As Foreign Secretary, I have sanctioned Hamas terrorists, and called on Israel to respect Palestinian civilians’ rights and freedoms. I have shown solidarity with the brave defenders of Ukraine, and backed the OSCE.Any violation and abuse is wrong – be it Iran’s execution of juvenile offenders, the Taliban trampling on women’s rights or China’s suppression of dissent.And so I am determined that the UK will: Hold malign actors to account. Offer support and sanctuary to victims. Defend the open international order.Second commitment: we will champion the open societies which guarantee these rights in the first place.Rights do not exist in a vacuum. The world’s poorest are increasingly found in states which lack respect for the rule of law, have high levels of corruption, and exclude citizens or communities.As our new Development White Paper makes clear, we will focus on tackling these issues. This is vital to protecting individual rights and unleashing every individual’s potential.Third, we do not seek to do this alone.We are proud of Britain’s free and tolerant society. But countless individuals worldwide contribute to realising human rights globally. Britain stands together with allies, friends and partners – old and new.We needed strength and unity to defeat Nazism. We needed strength and unity to realise the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And we need strength and unity to defend those rights today.And if we show that strength and unity, there is no reason that we cannot prevail.",Conservative
Anne-Marie Trevelyan,2023 Speech to the Western Australia Defence Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/anne-marie-trevelyan-2023-speech-to-the-western-australia-defence-conference/,"The speech made by Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Foreign Office Minister, in Perth, Australia on 8 December 2023.Thank you, Rebecca, for your kind introduction.Firstly, I acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land, the Whadjuk Noongar people, and I pay my respects to their Elders past, present and future.I am delighted to join you all today – my fourth trip to Australia this year, and my third to Perth.It is not just the beauty of this vibrant city, your family of black swans on the river, or your wonderful climate, that keep bringing me back. Although my friend Stephen Smith, Australia’s High Commissioner to the UK and fiercely proud former Federal Member for Perth, often teases me that it is!The reason I keep coming back is Perth’s significance to AUKUS as the future home of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet. And, as you welcomed USS North Carolina into port in August, it was clear for all to see that the ‘Optimal Pathway’ is now underway.The Royal Navy is looking forward to joining our American navy colleagues here more frequently from 2026, as our fleet of Astute class nuclear-powered submarines visits regularly, to strengthen our naval partnership to protect the region’s freedom of navigation across Indo-Pacific waters.Your recent visitor USS North Carolina was a demonstration of the continuing steps forward in the long journey towards SSN-AUKUS become reality.So what was the rationale for AUKUS?AUKUS is a security partnership of global significance.Events in Israel and Gaza, and Russia’s continuing attack against Ukraine, remind us how events far from our shores reverberate at home, with implications for our security, our economy, and our society.The UK government is under no illusion about the risks to global economic security if stability in the Indo-Pacific is shattered.As an island nation and a global trading power, like Australia, the UK depends on open shipping routes and unimpeded sea lanes.Free flows of trade, energy and data – above and below the surface – must be our continuing focus. Because the security of Indo-Pacific waters has a direct impact on my constituents in Northumberland as well as households across the UK and around the world.That is why we recommitted our support to a free and open Indo-Pacific in our foreign and defence policy refresh.AUKUS is the UK’s biggest investment in the stability of the Indo-Pacific, and broader global security, for half a century.Its positive impact will be felt in the region, in our relationships with two of our oldest and closest allies – but also across defence, industry and academia in all three partner countries.That is why I, and the UK Government, will do all we can to support you, bringing UK industrial and academic expertise honed over 60 years.Taking on a nuclear-powered fleet is an enormous endeavour, and Western Australia is critical to delivering the availability and sustainment of this new generation of submarines for the Australian Navy, the workforce to support them and the infrastructure to underpin their requirements.On each of my visits over the last year, I have met with critical stakeholders.  And I am excited to say that on this visit I am really starting to feel the momentum picking up on real partnership building and the investment picture needed.During this visit, I have met with leaders from Defence West, the Australian Submarine Agency, and Curtin University’s new AUKUS Workforce Alliance.We have hosted Western Australian leaders in the UK, including the Honourable Paul Papalia, to share our knowledge and discuss the most effective relationships which can help you build this new, hugely complex, enterprise with the help of our experienced industrial enterprise.And, of course, AUKUS isn’t only about submarines.I’ve seen for myself the expertise and advanced capabilities within Western Australia’s defence sector.From cyber to AI to remote operations, this region is well-positioned to do well from AUKUS Pillar Two. And from increasing collaboration with your UK and US counterparts.Last week, AUKUS Defence Ministers made a series of major announcements on Pillar Two that will build our mutual deterrence posture to make us stronger and create lots of opportunities for our defence industries.Joint exercises will continue to improve our ability to offset an opponent’s advantage, and increase the sophistication and impact of our autonomous naval systems.We will accelerate the development of quantum technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing in military capabilities. This will bolster the resilience of our forces in the most challenging environments, and enhance stealth in undersea capabilities, which will also support SSN-AUKUS.We will collaborate on the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability programme, which will use sites in all three countries to help identify emerging threats in space.And finally, we are working on cyber security with critical suppliers to the naval supply chain, which will give us greater insight into the threats to AUKUS and how to address them.The progress we are making proves that pooling resources and expertise, and focussing on interoperability, makes us stronger than we ever could be alone in tackling the present geopolitical strains.The delivery of AUKUSAUKUS has global significance. But its impacts are also in our local communities. AUKUS will be delivered by Australian, British, and American workers, civilian and uniformed. It will create and sustain thousands of jobs, and boost and regenerate industrial heartlands.The submarine enterprise – Pillar 1 – will bring together world-leading British design, with the very best technology, skills and industrial heft from all three partners.In the UK we have now committed £4bn of contracts to design and manufacture the first components for SSN-AUKUS. Rolls Royce is expanding its nuclear reactor manufacturing site in Derby, and BAe Systems is working with the town of Barrow to expand its site and skills. Babcock is continuing to invest in modernising their delivery of submarine sustainment and maintenance, which you will want to tap into in order to save time re-inventing the proverbial wheel.It’s good to see a few of the first cohort of workers from Australia embedded with UK and US counterparts, learning from the best and brightest in our defence industry.But let’s be under no illusion the scale of the challenge, especially in relation to the pace required to get to the start line.The scale and ambition of AUKUS is exciting for the defence industry. But at a time of heightened demand from Ukraine and Israel, and from other states who are bolstering their defences in light of Putin’s aggression, it will test the capability and capacity of defence sectors in all three partner nations.So, we must work together to build the next generations of designers, project managers, engineers, welders, and technicians. As well as the nuclear, cyber and digital experts, who will play a vital role in delivering AUKUS.These jobs demand unique skills and qualifications. Many require years of training. Developing the required workforce growth, without draining the existing skills bases, needs planning and investment.We also need to ensure our people can move easily between the three countries, to enable them to exchange knowledge, skills and experience. I know that the mobility agreement we agreed as part of our UK- Australia FTA last year will be important in supporting that flow.AUKUS is a multi-generational as well as multi-national endeavour, which will require us to adapt in order to continue to pull in the same direction.For the partnership to work to best effect, we need to ensure legal and regulatory frameworks are complementary. US ITAR controls being reviewed and legislated at the moment by US legislators, will enable us to navigate a path through export control regimes, so our industries can work more closely together.AUKUS is already changing how we work together, and we are working to overcome the challenges that arise from it.In the UK we are investing in our new Nuclear Skills Taskforce, to boost the capacity of our sector. We have appointed a cross-government Director-General of AUKUS, to provide leadership and enhance coordination.We must now work trilaterally to ramp up our engagement and delivery of urgent activity with industry. That’s why I was so pleased to hear about the brilliant Aukus Workforce Alliance created between HII, the US industrial maintenance lead for Virginias, Babcock, the UK’s industrial sustainment lead for UK Astutes and three Australian universities – Curtin, University of New South Wales and University of Adelaide. Forward thinking for the long-term skills challenge.We have established an AUKUS Defence Industry Forum, which will bring together governments and industry from all three countries to help drive forward delivery of advanced capabilities. And we have initiated the AUKUS Defence Investors Network to strengthen financing.To conclude, the scale of our ambition for the trilateral AUKUS partnership is vast, and there are enormous opportunities and responsibilities for government to enable industry to deliver the policy aims needed.Delivering across both Pillars of the partnership will be an exceptionally complex challenge. But it is a challenge we can overcome by working together.We must keep at the front of our minds at all times why we are doing this – we have a responsibility together to provide defence capabilities which will be capable of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific – not just for our trading and security interests, but for our neighbours, friends and allies.Global maritime security is under pressure – our challenge is to assure it in order to:facilitate those flows of trade, goods moved about seamlessly day in day out from so many Indo-Pacific nations to the world;assure flows of energy, by ship and by pipeline and undersea cables;and ensure the safety of undersea data cables which underpin our global financial services.These conversations are critically important to helping policy makers set this enormous project on the right road. So, thank you firstly to Senator Linda Reynolds for asking whether I would support this – of course!; and to Gordon Flake and the US Asia Centre and Business News for making it a reality.So – please do tell me what you think we need to do to deliver our shared ambitions for AUKUS, drawing on the rich talents of the people and businesses of Western Australia.  The simple question is are we going fast enough to enable you to deliver the requirements to sustain and maintain a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines here in Western Australia? Our mission is to reassure allies – and that will be achieved if we assure ourselves we are going hard and fast enough to meet delivery of the challenge.I know you won’t be shy in sharing your views, that’s one of the wonderful characteristics of Australians!Thank you.",Conservative
Robert Halfon,2023 Speech at the Times Higher Education Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-halfon-2023-speech-at-the-times-higher-education-conference/,"The speech made by Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in Liverpool on 7 December 2023.Times Higher Education is such an important voice for the sector, and I’m delighted to be speaking to you again.I want to start with a personal story about my relationship with higher education.I was born with a form of cerebral palsy, spastic diplegia. The doctors told my father I’d never be able do anything – to walk, live independently or, for example, go to university.Thanks to a Great Ormond Street doctor, I did learn to walk and went on to do things no one would have predicted – included going to university. I never imagined I’d be able to walk or cycle up the steep hills of Exeter, but I did. Going to university was the greatest time of my life. I greatly enjoyed getting my degree, and then staying on to do a masters.My experience taught me not just to highly value higher education – but to cherish it.A sector to be proud ofI’m proud that Britain has some of the best universities in the world.4 in the top 10, and 17 in the top 100. Students travel from over 200 nations to study here. And our universities lead the world in producing valuable research:We rank1st in the G7for publications’ impact.We also have excellent technical and vocational universities, which are expanding the concept of degree education. They are equipping students with premium skills for high-powered jobs, and collaborating with further education to deliver sought-after degree apprenticeships.And data releasedtodRobetayshows that we’re flinging wide the doors to university like never before. Thanks to the commitment you’ve shown to access and participation, disadvantaged English 18-year-olds are now 74% more likely to enter higher education than they were in 2010.I want to congratulate everyone in this room for their contribution to the picture I’ve described: the deans, lecturers, admissions tutors – all the academic teaching and research staff. And I also want to thank all those who aren’t in the room, but are just as important to making a university successful: the support staff, administrators, student counsellors and caterers. Everything that all of you do has made this sector what it is today.I recognise the financial pressures universities are under – and appreciate the work you are doing to manage these and deliver outstanding outcomes for young people.We’re working in a very challenging financial context across government. This means we must continue to make tough decisions to control public spending – but also try to help students with the cost-of-living, and ensure they receive value-for-money.Beveridge’s 5 GiantsLast year I laid out my 3 aims for higher education: jobs, skills and social justice.This year, to look to the future, I want to first look back to December 1942.Twentieth Century historians among you will recognise the year that Sir William Beveridge published his report on Britain’s social ills. As you will know, the Beveridge report went on to become the founding document for the welfare state.Beveridge described 5 giants that were standing in the way of the nation’s progress.They were idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want.Although the report was a blueprint for social security, Beveridge also acknowledges the evils he considered just as bad as income, housing or healthcare deficits.Namely, lack of education and employment.Beveridge described ignorance as something “no democracy can afford among its citizens”, and idleness as a force that ‘destroys wealth and corrupts men, whether they are well fed or not’.My 5 GiantsSo taking my cue from Beveridge, I want to talk about my 5 giants – the 5 challenges I believe higher education faces in this decade and beyond.They are higher education reforms, HE disruptors, degree apprenticeships, the lifelong learning entitlement and artificial intelligence and the fourth industrial revolution.I will end by talking about an unwelcome shift in culture on campus this autumn, and what we must do about it.HE reformI want to start with our ongoing higher education reforms, and the challenge they present to universities.The sector has evolved in the last 25 years to a widely-accessed, fee-paying model. Data from the Office for Students shows that students overwhelmingly progress to good employment, further study or other positive outcomes. However, government has a duty to monitor provision funded by tuition fees, to ensure that students receive value-for-money from the finance it provides – and which they must eventually pay back.Jobs, skills and social justice are what drives our higher education reforms. By legislating on what courses should cost and the outcomes students should expect, we are ensuring the sustainability and efficacy of the market. The challenge is for institutions to anticipate student needs and outcomes, and adapt their courses accordingly.One example is checking the rapid rise in foundation years in classroom-based subjects, such as business and management. We were concerned that lower delivery cost, rather than student need, was driving this growth. That’s why we’ve announced that from next year, we will reduce the maximum tuition fees and loans for foundation years in classroom-based subjects to £5,760.This lower fee limit represents a fairer deal for students.I believe this comes back to social justice.I’m glad to say that we have the highest completion rate in the OECD.But all courses that cost this much should have good continuation, completion and progression.Why should only those in-the-know, who apply for the right courses, go on to reap the greatest rewards from their HE investment? While others paying the same money receive poorer teaching with poorer outcomes. Everyone should be able to approach this market clear-eyed about what they can expect for their time and money.Disruptors of HE and tertiary education – Institutes of Technology and the Dyson InstituteThe second challenge is that presented by the new disruptors to higher education.Institutions that ensuring that students’ studies at university boost to their professional lives afterwards.The movement to link degrees with graduate jobs is exemplified by the Dyson institute of engineering and technology. As the first private employer in the country to be granted its own degree-awarding powers, the institute has streamlined students’ route to their graduate roles. They believe it’s worth teaching and awarding their own degrees, because it’s clearly the best way to get the candidates they need. And they’re not short of applicants vying for places! I commend Dyson’s extraordinary investment in their campus, where students are reaping the rewards of their work-focussed programmes. Everyone involved knows it’s worth their while.On a regional level, our government-backed Institutes of Technology (IoTs) are also challenging the status quo. As collaborations between business, HE and FE, they are a fast-track to good jobs.  They provide higher technical training in STEM specialisms, using the industry-standard equipment that colleges and training providers find prohibitively expensive. IoTs are employer-led, offering specialised courses tailored to local business needs, for local students. These multi-way relationships benefit all concerned, including the universities. Undergraduates who’ve experienced IoTs’ unique employer relationships arrive in their first job with higher occupational competency than traditional degree students.Degree ApprenticeshipsThe third challenge for HE is degree apprenticeships.They epitomise jobs, skills and social justice by eroding the false divide between further and higher education. Maintaining partition does nothing for either sector – particularly when there is so much to be gained from collaborating.Degree apprenticeships allow universities to reach students who could not otherwise afford undergraduate study. They offer a unique package of earning while learning at world-leading universities, and working for some of Britain’s top employers. 94% of Level 6 degree-apprentices go onto work or further training upon completion, with 93% in sustained employment. And all with no student finance to repay. With 170 to choose from, degree apprenticeships are opening-up professions previously closed to those not studying a traditional degree – a brilliant outcome which speaks for itself.What do degree apprenticeships have in common with the previous challenge – the disruptor institutes? They’re about preparing students for the world of work, so they’re ready to grab it with both hands.Many of you agree with me on how important this is. The University of East Londonencourages every student to do a work placement, no matter what they’re studying. Teesside University hadover 2,000degree-level apprentices on roll last year. And Warwick University’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Stuart Croft,has saidhe’d like 10% of his student body to be degree apprentices within the next decade. I applaud this, and encourage others to follow his lead. But I want a time to come when degree apprentices match the number of academic students on campus.I don’t see why we can’t get there. Degree-level apprenticeships have enjoyed year-on-year growth since their introduction, and now made-up 14% of all apprenticeships. But we need to diversify beyond the programmes that have fuelled expansion. That’s why I’ve made £40 million available for degree apprenticeship growth in the next two years – to get new courses off the ground, and engage with new candidates and businesses.It will take time, but the demand is already there! UCAS reports huge interest in these courses.The lifelong learning entitlement, and what it means for HEThe fourth challenge is the lifelong learning entitlement.William Beveridge said of adult education:The door of learning should not shut for anyone at 18, or at any time.Ignorance to its present extent is not only unnecessary, but dangerous.To open wide the door of learning we will expand student finance in 2025, creating parity between higher and technical education. The loan entitlement will be equivalent to four years of higher education funding (£37,000 in today’s fees) to use throughout a person’s working life.As well as conventional higher technical or degree level studies, it will be redeemable against high-value modular courses such as higher technical qualifications. HTQs are designed in collaboration with employers, giving students confidence that they provide the required skills for associated careers.This will galvanise people to train, retrain, and upskill across their careers, fitting shorter courses around their personal commitments. Like getting on and off a train, learners will be able to alight and board their post-school education when it suits them, rather than being confined to a single ticket. These are the students of the future, a new market seeking high quality tuition that universities are well-placed to provide.AI and the fourth industrial revolutionThe fifth and final challenge is Artificial Intelligence and the fourth industrial revolution.It is difficult to comprehend how much the world will change in the working lives of today’s undergraduates – much as it would have been difficult to explain the internet to our younger selves. Eventually, almost every daily transaction and interaction will have a digital archetype.The government is taking a proactive approach to AI research, with HE playing a pivotal role. The department for science, innovation and technology has funded over 2,600 postgraduate scholarships for underrepresented students to study AI and data science. Since 2018, UK Research and Innovation has invested £217 million in 24 Centres for doctoral training across the country, supporting over 1,500 PhDs. This investment is creating a new generation of researchers, developing AI usage for areas like healthcare and climate change.The fourth industrial revolution is already underway, creating new jobs and extinguishing others. Universities UK estimates that we’ll need11 million extra graduatesby 2023 to fill newly-created roles. Unit for Future Skills’ research shows that professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly clerical work in law, finance and business management.To build a workforce for this revolution, we need to expose undergraduates to real-world work whilst building a culture of lifelong learning and re-training.Sophie Scholl and antisemitismI want to turn now to someone else who, like William Beveridge, was trying to make the world a better place in 1942. Someone who ultimately paid for it with her life.My political hero is a young woman called Sophie Scholl. Again, I expect 20th Century historians will recognise the name. She was a member of the White Rose resistance group who distributed anti-Nazi leaflets in Germany. She was a university student in Munich, where her final act of defiance led to her arrest and execution.The White Rose called on citizens to resist the Nazis and denounced the murder of Jewish people. But Sophie wasn’t Jewish – one of the reasons I admire her so much. She didn’t lose her life through any self-interest. She and her comrades knew what was happening was wrong, and did something about it.So why mention Sophie today? Because the antisemitism in our universities this autumn has been horrific. Since the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel, the University Jewish Chaplaincy has documented threatening door-knocking – “we know where you live” – verbal and physical abuse, graffiti, Palestinian flags draped over Jewish students’ cars..I have welcomed statements condemning antisemitism from vice chancellors across the country. But we need to be proactive, not just reactive. That’s why the secretary of state and I have written twice to universities on this. And why we’re looking introduce an antisemitism charter to give teeth to the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism.Sophie Scholl once said that the real damage is done by “those with no sides and no causes… Those who don’t like to make waves – or enemies.”I want Sophie Scholls to exist in every university. Non-Jews prepared to stand-up for their Jewish friends, who’s done nothing to deserve the stigma and hatred they’ve endured.Government can only do so much. Action against antisemitism needs to come from within.I‘ve laid-out 5 – or rather 6 – challenges to you today.They are substantial, but I have full faith in your ability to meet them.While it’s right that the government holds the sector to account, your universities are an enormous source of national pride.

Rishi Sunak,2023 Speech on Illegal Migration,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-speech-on-illegal-migration/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, in London on 7 December 2023.Today the government has introduced the toughest anti-illegal immigration law ever.I know it will upset some people and you will hear a lot of criticism about it.It’s right to explain why I have decided to do this.I’m the child of immigrants…I understand why some people take the risk of getting into unsafe dinghies to cross open waters……it’s because the United Kingdom is an incredible country… it offers opportunity, hope and safety.But the difference is… my family came here… legally.Like most immigrants, they integrated into local communities……worked hard to provide for their family…built lives and businesses, found friends and neighbours…… and most of all… they were really proud to become British.That feeling of pride… it cascades down the generations and grows… and that’s why you see so many children of immigrants sitting around the Cabinet table.But it’s not a given… illegal immigration undermines not just our border controls… it undermines the very fairness that is so central to our national character.We play by the rules. We put in our fair share. We wait our turn.Now if some people can just cut all that out… you’ve not just lost control of your borders… you’ve fatally undermined the very fairness upon which trust in our system is based.That’s why this legislation is necessary.To deliver an effective deterrent to those who wish to come here illegally……to restore people’s trust that the system is fair…… and ultimately: to stop the boats.And so, our Bill today fundamentally addresses the Supreme Court’s concerns over the safety of Rwanda.I did not agree with their judgement, but I respect it.That is why I have spent the last three weeks working tirelessly to respond to their concerns……and to guarantee Rwanda’s safety in a new legally binding international treaty.The Supreme Court were clear that they were making a judgement about Rwanda at a specific moment 18 months ago…and that the problems could be remedied.Today we are confirming that they have been……and that unequivocally, Rwanda is a safe country.And today’s Bill also ends the merry-go-round of legal challenges that have blocked our policy for too long.We simply cannot have a situation where our ability to control our borders……and stop people taking perilous journeys across the channel……is held up in endless litigation in our courts.So this Bill gives Parliament the chance to put Rwanda’s safety beyond question in the eyes of this country’s law.Parliament is sovereign. It should be able to make decisions that cannot be undone in the courts.And it was never the intention of international human rights laws……to stop a sovereign Parliament removing illegal migrants to a country that is considered safe in both parliamentary statute and international law.So the Bill does include what are known as “notwithstanding” clauses.These mean that our domestic courts will no longer be able to use any domestic or international law……including the Human Rights Act……to stop us removing illegal migrants.Let me just go through the ways individual illegal migrants try and stay.Claiming asylum – that’s now blocked.Abuse of our Modern Slavery rules – blocked.The idea that Rwanda isn’t safe – blocked.The risk of being sent on to some other country – blocked.And spurious Human Rights claims – you’d better believe we’ve blocked those too……because we’re completely disapplying all the relevant sections of the Human Rights Act.And not only have we blocked all these ways illegal migrants will try and stay……we’ve also blocked their ability to try and stay by bringing a Judicial Review on any of those grounds.That means that this Bill blocks every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda from taking off.The only, extremely narrow exception will be if you can prove with credible and compelling evidence…….that you specifically have a real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm.We have to recognise that as a matter of law – and if we didn’t, we’d undermine the treaty we’ve just signed with Rwanda.As the Rwandans themselves have made clear……if we go any further the entire scheme will collapse.And there’s no point having a Bill with nowhere to send people to.But I am telling you now, we have set the bar so high……that it will be vanishingly rare for anyone to meet it.And once you have been removed, you’ll be banned for life from travelling to the UK, settling here, or becoming a citizen.But, of course, even with this new law here at home……we could still face challenges from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.So let me repeat what I said two weeks ago –I will not allow a foreign court to block these flights.If the Strasbourg Court chooses to intervene against the express wishes of our sovereign Parliament……I will do what is necessary to get flights off.And today’s new law already makes clear that the decision on whether to comply with interim measures issued by the European Court……is a decision for British government Ministers – and British government Ministers alone.Because it is your government – not criminal gangs, or indeed foreign courts –who decides who comes here and who stays in our country.Now of course, our Rwanda policy is just one part of our wider strategy to stop the boats.And that strategy is working.I’ve been Prime Minister for just over a year now and for the first time, small boat arrivals here are down by a third….…even as illegal crossings of the Mediterranean have soared by 80 per cent.Let me just repeat that: small boat arrivals here are down by a third.To help achieve that, we’ve signed returns and co-operation agreements with France, Bulgaria, Turkey, Italy, and Georgia.Illegal working raids are up by nearly 70 per cent.50 hotels are being returned to their local communities and we are housing people in a new barge and in former military sites.The initial asylum backlog is down from 92,000 to less than 20,000.We’ve returned over 22,000 illegal migrants.And as our deal with Albania shows – deterrence works.Last year, a third of all those arriving in small boats were Albanian.This year we have returned 5,000 people and cut those arrivals by 90 per cent.And Albanian arrivals have far more recourse to the courts than anyone under this new legislation.That’s why I’m so confident that this Bill will work.Lord Sumption, the former Supreme Court Judge, believes this Bill will work.We will get flights off the ground.We will deter illegal migrants from coming here.And we will, finally, stop the boats.",Conservative

Oliver Dowden,2023 Speech on Cyber Operations,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/oliver-dowden-2023-speech-on-cyber-operations/,"The speech made by Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister, on 7 December 2023.Of all the risks that this country faces… there are none that are evolving more rapidly than those in the cyber domain.More actors…Have more sophisticated tools…To target more people…Than ever.Protecting the public from cyber attack is a matter of the utmost importance.Let’s be clear what’s being targeted here.The critical services that government delivers:Our public finances…Our roads and railways…Our schools…Our health service…Our armed forces…Even the heart of central government itself.Of all the vaults that cyber criminals are desperate to crack into…… this one contains some of the greatest rewards.That’s why we see so many attempts to breach our digital defences.Last year, 40 per cent of the attacks addressed by the National Cyber Security Centre were against the public sector.In a world where the new frontline is online……the people in this room are manning the barricades to keep us safe and secure…… and for that I want to say thank you.Despite the challenges we face, our cyber defences are stronger than ever.Since it was published two years ago, the Government Cyber Security Strategy has been a game-changer.Work is well underway to ensure that government’s most critical functions are significantly hardened to cyber attack.And we have established ambitious targets that will see all government organisations made resilient to known vulnerabilities and common attack methods.Through GovAssure – which I launched in April – we have transformed the oversight of governmental cybersecurity…And the new ‘Government Cyber Coordination Centre’ – better known as ‘GC3’ is bringing together a community of cyber defenders from across government……sharing best practice…… and showing that a “whole of government approach” is not a slogan, it’s a reality.Working together with the National Cyber Advisory Board… (which I Chair)……and of course the National Cyber Security Centre.All of you play a crucial role in iterating the strategy…… and ensuring it is implemented right across Government.Your work never stops… because the risk of attack never stops.The threats we face are increasing and the nature of those threats is evolving.Technologies are developing at an exponential rate……and have lowered the bar for hostile actors – states and criminals.The biggest cyber threats are not just to our public services but the democratic means by which we deliver them.Some states are likely to be harnessing significantly more sophisticated technology to sow confusion and dissension and chaos in our society.Malicious actors continue to target high profile people within the political process.This is not an abstract possibility. We have already seen it…In Ukraine – with deep-fakes of President Zelensky…In the US – where Iranian hackers have been indicted for undermining voter confidence and sowing discord…And here in the UK – with our Electoral Commission targeted by a complex cyber attack.As I warned at CYBERUK in Belfast in April……the greatest risks still emanate from the “usual suspects”……China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.But they are increasingly using ‘Wagner-style’ sub-state hackers to do their dirty work.Today in concert with our Five Eyes and Euro-Atlantic partners….I can tell you that a unit within the Russian Federal Security Service, known as Centre 18, has been behind sustained hostile cyber operations……aimed at interfering in parts of the UK’s democratic processes…This has included targeting members of parliament……Civil servants, think tanks, journalists, and NGOs……through a group commonly known as Star Blizzard.This group, operated by FSB officers, has also selectively leaked and amplified information designed to undermined trust in politics, both in the UK and in like minded states.A senior representative of the Russian government has been summoned to the Foreign Office this morning and appropriate sanctions have been levelled.Our political processes and institutions will continue to endure in spite of these attacks.But they serve to prove that the cyber threat posed by the Russian Intelligence Services is real and serious.It is a stark reminder that…as we in government develop our capabilities……so do our adversaries, and those who do their bidding.We are in a cyberspace race……them – to develop the tools to do us harm……us – to build the defences needed to protect against their attacks.Next year, 3 billion people in 40 countries will head to the polls …… and it is a fact that hostile state actors will continue to seek to undermine these collective expressions of democracy……because they fear the freedoms they represent.We must – all of us – do all we can to resist.There are two main ways in which we can get ahead:Strengthening our cyber security systems……and improving our skills.First, our systems.It wasn’t that long ago that the government was still using fax machines.I worked for the administration that helped to bring Whitehall into the digital age……and made our services “digital by default”.The challenge is to make those digital systems “secure by design”…and to embed effective cyber security practices into our digital delivery.That’s why I am announcing today that we will make security everyone’s responsibility……and make “secure by design” mandatory for central government organisations.This approach is already inspiring our partners around the world……and, like our earlier digital revolution, is likely to be emulated around the world.Your role in embedding this approach at home will be crucial.Then there is the question of skills.In this room we have a wealth of deep technical expertise……and we have the ability to share and collaborate with our international partners.But we need the experts of the future to be coming up, through that pipeline, to meet the challenges of the future.In the UK, as around the world, the shortage of cyber skills affects both the public and private sectors.It is estimated that we have a shortfall of around 14,000 professionals….…and that shortfall is particularly stark in the public sector.As one of the largest employers of cyber security experts, the government’s actions can make a real difference to the makeup of the national profession.So we have launched apprenticeship and fast stream programmes focused specifically on finding and developing  cyber talent.This is the new frontline.And we must form a united front……government, business, academia, individuals, all coming together to pre-empt and ward off these risks.Not just “whole of government” – but “whole of society”.It is what we have that our adversaries and their agents lack: unity.And there are huge opportunities in that……particularly for our entrepreneurs and innovators.They will develop the defensive technologies that will protect not just this country… but the world.Britain has the opportunity to lead … in tech, in AI and in cyber……because the best place in the world to do business must also be the safest place in the world to do business……and together we can make that a reality.Thank you.",Conservative

Stuart Andrew,2023 Speech to the GambleAware Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2023-speech-to-the-gambleaware-annual-conference/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Gambling Minister, in London on 6 December 2023.Good afternoon, everyone. I am absolutely delighted to join you here today.It really is inspiring to look out at the room and see such a variety of voices come together to think about our shared ambition to prevent gambling-related harm, and to build a society which provides the right level of support when and where it is needed most. I would like to specifically acknowledge the role GambleAware has played in pushing forward this objective.I know many of you in the room have paid very close attention to the plans for a white paper since the launch of our Call for Evidence back in 2020. I know it has been a long road for all of us but I am very pleased that we were finally able to publish a substantial set of proposals. Those clearly outlined the government’s vision for the sector and a commitment to strengthening protections against gambling-related harms.Central to that ambition is of course the decision to introduce a statutory levy, which will transform how research, prevention and treatment is funded. It will mandate for the first time how gambling companies contribute their fair share towards battling the impact of gambling harms.We are working quickly to get the levy, and all the other protections outlined in the white paper, in place as soon as we can, through a range of mechanisms.For example, we have recently included a provision in the Criminal Justice Bill – going through Parliament at the moment – to give the Commission greater powers to tackle the black market. This is just one example, but we will continue to pursue whatever route delivers the protections quickest or the most effectively.As you all know, earlier this year we published our gambling white paper, the most comprehensive review of gambling laws in 15 years. With multiple consultations already completed or in progress we remain very much on track to deliver the main measures of our review by the summer of next year, including the statutory levy.I know all of you are particularly invested in the levy consultation, and ensuring that we introduce a system that builds an holistic approach to investment in tackling gambling harms. It represents a generational change to funding arrangements for research, prevention and treatment; and will ensure that we have an effective, integrated system between public and third sector to tackle gambling harms.That is why we are consulting. We have always taken an evidence-led approach and will continue to ensure that the government considers the best available information. It is important to me that your views inform our approach to implementing this landmark reform in an effective, evidence-led and proportionate way.We have welcomed the financial contributions that industry has made to research, education and treatment since the introduction of the Gambling Act.But funding is not the only requirement, and this alone will not achieve our objective for a system which is equitable, ensures a high degree of long-term funding certainty, and guarantees independence.For the first time, the levy will ensure trusted and sustainable funding to not just pay for treatment, but to further understand and tackle the sources of gambling harm through vital investment in research and prevention.It will help to better protect people and ensure that the necessary funding is being delivered effectively and directed where it is needed most.The levy will be paid by gambling operators and collected by the Gambling Commission, with spending decisions approved by DCMS and the Treasury, putting the flow and independence of funding beyond doubt.I am confident in the way forward and the meaningful opportunities the levy presents. But getting the transition right and ensuring all parties are working closely together is my immediate priority.To me this means two things:Firstly: Keeping funding flowing. We have to guarantee that funding remains secure and accessible through the existing system to deliver the important work that many of you are directly involved in on the frontline. It is absolutely crucial for me that there is no disruption to services in the interim.Secondly: Getting the timing right. We need to manage the introduction of the levy and the build-up to full funding so that there is sufficient time to get the right infrastructure, processes and relationships in place.Together, this will support a smooth transition to the new system.Since the launch of the consultation, I have been engaging widely with stakeholders across the sector on these issues and will continue to do so – my message to you is that my door will always be open. I want to make clear today that I have received a commitment from industry to maintain funding until the levy is in force. My department and I are working at pace to see that commitment communicated in no uncertain terms to the sector.On the broader point around transition, it is vital that we walk before we can run. We need to take the time to get it right.This will then mean moving quickly to introduce the levy in Parliament so that the statutory foundations are there. But then I want a clear roadmap in place to ensure that your great work has the time and resources to flourish, while we look to improve and expand our collective efforts to prevent gambling-related harms.I would now like to turn to prevention.Too often we see and hear about the devastating impacts of harmful gambling. The Commission’s important work through the Gambling Survey for Great Britain recently presented a higher quality picture of gambling participation and harm than has existed previously.While the Survey is still in development and the statistics are experimental, the indication is that 2.5% of adults are gambling with negative consequences, with even greater numbers at risk. This makes clear that while the majority of people gamble safely, there is still more to do to tackle gambling related harm.Our white paper outlines a host of new measures we and the Gambling Commission are implementing to protect those most at risk.But prevention is also about creating a society which has a clear awareness of gambling-related harms, the right support available for those in need, and trust in the services themselves.Stigma is perhaps the biggest barrier preventing people from seeking help, and I want to specifically mention GambleAware’s vital campaign, which is helping to raise awareness of the issue and helping people take that all important first step to getting the support they need.An effective prevention plan seeks to identify the right mix of interventions at both the population and individual level. Done well this helps to build an educated, supported and protected society when it comes to gambling-related harm.For the first time, the levy will provide sustainable funding for the government to develop a coordinated prevention approach, at the local, regional and national level, providing investment for organisations across Great Britain.This will facilitate more upstream interventions where intervention is most critical and most effective.This is why I felt it was important to take a broad approach to our consultation in relation to prevention. I want us to closely consider the full range of perspectives and options available so that we can design an effective system to deliver the targeted prevention we require.I hope the consultation made our ambitions in this space clear. I want to see a levy system which prevents and reduces harm much earlier, while ensuring the right services are available for those who need them across our country.For that, we need the best available evidence, especially from those with lived experience, to create the right structures for the funding, commissioning and evaluation of prevention activity.I want to be absolutely clear that fulfilling this ambition is, and will be, impossible without the third sector.The essential work that GambleAware and many of you in the room have taken forward over the years has provided support and education for so many people; many of whom may have otherwise been left confused, facing closed doors or experiencing further harm. I want to thank you sincerely for that.I am not just saying this as someone who has worked in the third sector. Charities and local organisations are often closer to the populations they are trying to help, support and treat. I am fully aware of that and it is a priority for me that we do not lose expertise in the system.Effective and innovative collaboration between public bodies and the third sector is absolutely vital.We want a system which has no ‘wrong door’ for people seeking help, where the referral pathways are right and where learning is constantly being shared. I hope you will agree that this is an important objective for the future of an effective system of research, prevention and treatment of gambling-related harms.Thank you once again for inviting me to speak today. It is really heartening to see this group come together to discuss and collaborate on such an important range of issues.I know that Andrew Rhodes, who is up next, will agree with me on the importance of collaboration, and I thank him for the work the Commission is taking forward at considerable speed to help us deliver on the white paper.I hope that you will all engage with our consultation on the levy which closes next week, and that the rest of today’s discussions are productive and I look forward to continuing working with you all.",Conservative
Michelle Donelan,2023 Speech to the Horizon Celebration Event,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/michelle-donelan-2023-speech-to-the-horizon-celebration-event/,"The speech made by Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, on 4 December 2023.From day one of becoming Britain’s first Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology,I made a commitment……to place the views and voices of our greatest innovators and our boldest researchers right at the heart of my department’s work.They told me loud and clear how essential Horizon Europe was for ensuring that British science could play its part on the world stage.And I agreed.We also agreed on the importance of securing a good deal – one that gives the best and the brightest of the UK’s scientific community access to the world’s largest research collaboration programme.A deal that delivers for British scientists, taxpayers, and businesses.I am proud that today we have signed, sealed and delivered that deal……A bespoke agreement which is not just in their best interests,but in the best interests of global scientific endeavour and discovery.Months of painstaking work, of close negotiations, of Ministers and officials working around the clock with their EU counterparts have all culminated in this defining moment.The agreement we are celebrating today gives us a chance to write a new chapter in the story of British and European collaboration……One which will see our greatest minds working together…… unlocking the bold scientific breakthroughs of tomorrow…… and bringing our colossal collective strength to bear on the greatest challenges of our time – from our quest for new, clean, green energy through to finding cures for conditions like heart disease and dementia.And to anyone who doubts the scale of our ambition or the significance of the deal that has been agreed,I say: just look at what we have already accomplished.Under our association to Horizon 2020 the UK established over 230,000 collaborative links across 163 countries.And together we expanded the frontiers of knowledge…Take Graphene Core 3.A boundary-breaking project which saw some of our finest universities including Cambridge, Warwick andUCLworking with a dream team of academics and businesses across over 20 European countries.This led to a brand-new patented technology which can harness hydrogen fuel cells.It bolstered us to take another massive leap forward towards our net zero future.In our thriving life sciences sector, Imperial College worked with Horizon partners on developing a newHIVvaccine.And thanks to the pooling of resources and the sharing of expertise, this crucial research helped launch early-stage clinical trials.As Sir Elton John told British MPs just last week,we have turned the corner in our fight againstHIVand it is scientists working through Horizon which have helped us get there.but tonight our eyes are firmly fixed on the future……I want us to support Horizon Europe’s mission to create 300,000 new well-paid jobs by 2040.And I want us to play a leading role in areas likeAI– a game-changing technology which will define this decade.This is an area in which Britain can bring so much to the global table.We have led the international charge in supportingAI’s safe development, with the historic Bletchley Declaration signed by the EU and 28 other nations just last month.Now, our greatest minds and thinkers can contribute to Horizon partnerships inAI, Data and Robotics worth over £2 billion.And we can bolster Horizon’s scientific missions which I know will deliver enormous benefits for people in Britain, in Europe and around the world.That includes Horizon’s cancer mission – accelerating research into better preventing, diagnosing and treating this life-threatening disease….…A mission to support 3 million patients by 2030.In the UK, we have set ourselves our own target of diagnosing three-quarters of cancers at stages 1 or 2 by 2028.The two will complement and reinforce each other and advance our global efforts to treat and cure cancer.In partnership with the British Academy, and other key backers, we intend to support selected UK researchers applying for Horizon pillar 2, through ‘pump priming’ funding. Up to £10,000 will be available per application.We want to give support to those researchers who have not had experience with Horizon before, including next generation researchers – so the fund will target to ensure we can maximise the UK’s involvement in the world’s largest research collaboration This will enable more of our inventors, researchers and innovators to submit strong applications so they can turn their exciting, ground-breaking, world-changing ideas into reality.Of course, beyond Horizon, the deal we are celebrating today also meansparticipation in Copernicus and its state-of-the art earth observation system.It is a huge win-win…It is a win for our academics reinventing how we predict complex weather patterns.How we fight climate change.How we revolutionise agriculture.It is a win for dozens of British businesses in the earth observation sector.Businesses who are ready and raring to bid for multi-million-pound contracts to help design and deliver Copernicus technology.I know everyone in this room shares my excitement about what lies ahead.Louis Pasteur told us that ‘Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity. It is the torch which illuminates the world.’That spirit of global cooperation has defined the Horizon programme since its inception.In this pursuit of new ideas, new breakthroughs, new knowledge,The UK is delighted to join you once more.And we will be with you every step of the way.Thank you.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2023 Speech on the Economy,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-speech-on-the-economy/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, in Enfield on 20 November 2023.I’m here today to talk about the central purpose of our economic policy:To give you the opportunity to build a wealthier, more secure life for you and your family.We should not be apologetic about that.About the nobility of aspiration, the rewards of hard work, the dreams we have for ourselves and our children:Owning our own home.Starting a business.A healthy, happy retirement.And leaving our children a more comfortable life.But I know that right now, that dream feels out of reach for too many.So the most urgent choice our country faces, is how we change that.[Please note: Political content redacted here]Our approach is different.One that gets inflation down and keeps it down.One that believes the private sector grows the economy……and where government has a role, it must be limited.One that believes in cutting taxes – but doing so carefully and sustainably.And one that is ambitious about the unprecedented opportunities for this country……from the new wave of technology. Our approach starts with controlling inflation.High inflation eats away at your pay packet.It makes mortgages more expensive and stops you getting on the housing ladder.It makes pensions and savings worth less.In other words, inflation is a tax.And it erodes that dream of a wealthier, more secure life that we want for everyone.And that’s why we’ve provided unprecedented support for people’s energy bills and the cost of living.And it’s why at the start of this year, I committed to halve inflation.Back then, inflation was around 11%.And now, in October, the Office for National Statistics confirmed it fell to 4.6%.Now I’m not saying the job is done.But it does mean we have met our commitment to halve inflation.Prices are no longer rising as quickly.Energy bills have fallen significantly.And for many, wages are now rising faster than prices.And it shows something else:That when we make a major economic commitment, we will deliver it.It would’ve been far easier to give into the strikes with inflationary pay rises……or any number of calls for higher spending and borrowing.But we held firm.And with inflation halved, we can now look forward……towards the future economy that we want to build.As we do so, the country faces a critical choice about how we grow the economy.Do we continue with the big government, high spending, high borrowing, and high taxes, that were necessary through the pandemic?Or, as we believe, should we change our approach, and grow the economy through the dynamism of the private sector?Nothing shows the difference between those two visions more than the people asking you to believe in them.I’ve spent most of my career working and investing in businesses, large and small.The Chancellor spent his life before politics starting and running businesses.That’s where we learnt about the economy.My approach is rooted in what I learned growing up, working in Mum’s pharmacy.She worked so hard – we all worked so hard – not just because that was where our living came from.But because it was ours; we owned it; we all had a stake in its success.If we worked hard and took pride in our work and provided a good service, then business would improve.If we didn’t, it wouldn’t.The economy is about people, free to pursue their own ideas, in their own interests, in their own way.To support themselves and their families through the dignity of their own work.I’m not saying government has no role.My record is not that of a market fundamentalist.When a crisis hits, governments must intervene – just as we I did with furlough.The state must step in where the private sector won’t.Not least to provide high quality public services like the NHS…Or to improve public health with our plan to create a smoke-free generation…Or to invest in our future growth, with infrastructure, skills, and the incredible opportunities of science and technology.And in a world where Putin is willing to weaponise energy……and we face the strategic challenge of a more assertive China……we must be smarter about protecting our economic security.But our opponents are profoundly wrong to argue……that the shocks we’ve seen in the last few years, or the need to transition to Net Zero……mean we should borrow £28 billion a year, and permanently have bigger government.We should be as clear-eyed about government failure as we are about market failure.So the bar to intervene in people’s lives should be high.Because history tells us that if it’s not, the inevitable conclusion is……higher spending, higher borrowing, higher mortgage rates, and higher taxes.Greater regulation and intervention, stifling people’s energy and initiative.Less trade, meaning less choice and higher prices.And economic power concentrated in the hands of a small government elite……allowing more influence for vested interests and the trade unions.This is a recipe for stagnation, not growth.And it would take our country backwards, not forwards.So we choose a different path to deliver growth.Where we back people and businesses.Where the state is there for you during the bad times but gets out of the way during the good.And where the path to prosperity lies not in ever more government intervention……but in creating the conditions for businesses to thrive.And so to grow the economy, we will take five long-term decisions.Reducing debt.Cutting tax and rewarding hard work.Building domestic, sustainable energy.Backing British business.And delivering world-class education.The first long-term decision is to reduce our debt……to keep inflation falling and get mortgage rates down to affordable levels.Without financial security, we can’t do anything to support families and workers when they need it most.When Covid struck, we could only act because our public finances were in good shape……thanks to the difficult but responsible decisions we’ve taken over the last decade.I’ll always be proud of being the Chancellor who protected nine million jobs……in a moment of danger, fear, and uncertainty, people turned to this government……and did not find us wanting.I’m proud of the support we provided to the NHS, with record levels of funding.I’m proud too, of helping households pay their energy bills when Putin cut off the gas.But the only way to give people the peace of mind that government will be there in future crises……is to pay down our debts now.And if we don’t, we’re just leaving our children to pay the bill.Last September was a stark reminder why this matters so much.The country was rocked by a financial crisis caused, in part, because investors didn’t believe the UK had a plan to control our debt.That’s why the Chancellor and I have taken difficult decisions to control our debt.That wasn’t the easy thing to do – but it was the right thing to do for our country.And that’s what leadership means.It takes political courage to take the difficult but right decisions for the long-term.I will do what is necessary to get our debt down and provide financial security. The second decision we’re taking is to cut tax and reward hard work.Now I want to cut taxes.I believe in cutting taxes.What clearer expression could there be of my governing philosophy than the belief……that people, and not governments, make the best decisions about their own money?But doing that responsibly is hard.We must avoid doing anything that puts at risk our progress in controlling inflation.And no matter how much we might want them to, history shows that tax cuts don’t automatically pay for themselves.And I can’t click my fingers and suddenly wish away all the reasons that taxes had to increase in the first place.Partly, because of Covid and Putin’s war in Ukraine.And partly because we want to support people to live in dignity in retirement……with a decent pension and good healthcare – which will cost more as the population ages.But my argument has never been that we shouldn’t cut taxes.It’s been that we could only cut taxes once we’ve controlled inflation and debt.First cut inflation, then cut taxes.And that’s why I made the promise to halve inflation.And the official statistics show, that promise has now been met.So, now that inflation is halved…And our growth is stronger, meaning revenues are higher……we can begin the next phase, and turn our attention to cutting tax.We will do this in a serious, responsible way……based on fiscal rules to deliver sound money……and alongside the independent forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility.And we can’t do everything all at once.It will take discipline and we need to prioritise.But over time, we can and we will cut taxes.Rewarding hard work also means reforming our welfare system.We believe in the inherent dignity of a good job.And we believe that work – not welfare – is the best route out of poverty.Yet right now, around two million people of working age are not working at all.That is a national scandal and an enormous waste of human potential.So, we must do more to support those who can work, to do so.And we will clamp down on welfare fraudsters.Because the system must be fair for the taxpayers who fund it.And by doing all of this…By getting people off welfare and into work……we can better support those genuinely in need of a safety net.That is what a compassionate, welfare system looks like.Our third long-term decision is to build domestic, sustainable energy.Energy security is national security.It underpins everything in our economy so there can be no plan for growth without it.And the transition to net zero will create whole new sectors……and hundreds of thousands of good, well-paid jobs right across the country.Yet there is almost no better example of how British politics has failed in recent decades……than our inability to develop a serious strategy for energy.We’re now correcting those mistakes, with new nuclear power plants.Record investment in renewables.And upgrades to our electricity grid infrastructure.But there is no path to energy security……and indeed no credible path to net zero……without secure supplies of oil and gas.Never again can we allow our energy security to be compromised.I believe British energy will deliver British energy security.Now I deeply believe that when you ask most people about climate change, they want to do the right thing.And I’m proud that since 1990, Britain has reduced our emissions faster than any other major economy.But it can’t be right to impose such significant costs on working people……especially those already struggling to make ends meet.And to interfere so much in people’s lives without a properly informed national debate.Instead of following the path of ideological zeal, reaching Net Zero no matter what the cost.Or to build new supplies of domestic, sustainable energy……to grow the economy and cut the cost of Net Zero for working people.The fourth decision we’re taking is to back British businesses to invest, innovate, and trade.Now that might sound obvious or uncontroversial.We want to support businesses to invest, innovate and grow through lower taxes and simpler regulation……and where we provide support, it should be targeted and strategic.So yes, we’re investing in roads, railways, broadband and mobile networks, right across the country.Yes, we’re delivering one of the biggest ever transport upgrades for the north and midlands, in Network North.And yes, we’re delivering the right homes in the right places to support the labour market.But growth is all about getting the private sector to invest, too.That’s why the Chancellor is cutting taxes directly on investment.It’s why we’re cutting taxes to encourage innovation……because new ideas and ways of doing things are the most important ways to raise our productivity.And it’s why we’re seizing the freedom and flexibility of Brexit.We’ve already cut Brussels red tape to save small businesses a billion pounds a year.We’re creating more agile regulation to support innovation and competition……particularly in growth sectors like financial services, life sciences, and agri-tech.And we’re building new trade deals with the fastest growing regions in the world, like CPTPP.So this is our message to business:The Chancellor and I spent most of our careers in business.We understand, we care, we get it, and we’re acting to make this the best country in the world to do business.Now, our final long-term decision is about delivering world-class education……so young people have the skills they need to get good jobs.Education is about opportunity.About giving people the knowledge and skills to get on in life and fulfil their aspirations.And about preparing the country for the profound transformation technologies like AI will bring.I’m incredibly proud of our record since 2010.Higher standards; more choice for parents; more powers for teachers.And the result?State schools in some of the most deprived parts of our country are now producing some of the best results.And we are doing more.Our new qualification, the Advanced British Standard will:For the first time, put technical education on an equal footing with academic courses.Dramatically increase time spent in the classroom.Teach Maths and English to every child through to 18, with extra help for those struggling most.And give students the chance to study a much broader range of subjects.We know that brilliant teachers make for a brilliant education, so we’re going to back them.We’ve doubled the grants for new teachers in key subjects to £30,000 over five years……and for the first time extended those grants to colleges as well as schools.To conclude, the first time many of you saw me was during Covid, when I stood up at a Press Conference to announce the furlough scheme.From that moment until today, whether you like me or not……I hope you know that when it comes to the economy……when it comes to your job, your family, your incomes……I’ll always take the right decisions for our country.I promised you we would halve inflation.We took the difficult decisions and have delivered on that promise.Now you can trust me when I say we can start to responsibly cut taxes.And we will now move to the next phase of our plan, to grow our economy by…Reducing debt;Cutting tax and rewarding hard work;Building domestic, sustainable energy;Backing British business;And delivering world-class education.You can trust me to take the right long-term decisions and that’s how we’ll build a brighter future for our children.Thank you.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2023 Speech at the COP28 Climate Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-speech-at-the-cop28-climate-summit/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, in Dubai on 1 December 2023.I’m here at COP28 with two clear messages…First, the world needs to do more to tackle climate change.We’ve made real progress – including at the Glasgow summit……but the climate science and mounting evidence of climate-related disasters……show we’re not moving quickly or effectively enough.So I’m calling on major emitters to dramatically accelerate delivery on what they’ve already promised.Everyone can do more.And let’s be very clear – the UK is leading the charge.We’re absolutely committed to our Net Zero targets.We’ve already decarbonised faster than any other major economy.Our emissions are down 48 percent since 1990.Compared to limited cuts from others.And a 300 percent increase from China.We’re also one of the largest climate donors, because we want to help those suffering the impacts of climate change.My pledge from September of £1.6 billion for the Green Climate Fund was the UK’s biggest single climate change commitment.And we’re going further… announcing £1.6 billion today for renewable energy, green innovation and forests……delivering on the historic Glasgow deal to end deforestation – because we can’t tackle climate change without nature.We’re also leveraging the genius of the City of London to deliver billions more in private finance.Again the UK is leading by example… and we need others to step up.Because my second message is this…As I said in September, we won’t tackle climate change unless we take people with us.Climate politics is close to breaking point.The British people care about the environment.They know that the costs of inaction are intolerable.But they also know that we have choices about how we act.So yes we’ll meet our targets……but we’ll do it in a more pragmatic way, which doesn’t burden working people.We’ve scrapped plans on heat pumps and energy efficiency, which would have cost families thousands of pounds.We’ll help people to improve energy efficiency and cut bills – but we won’t force them too.We’ll support nature across the UK.Just this week I announced a huge new effort with 34 landscape recovery projects, a new national park – and more.And we’ll harness the opportunities of technology and green industry to deliver net zero in a way that benefits the British people.And today I can share more proof on the progress we’re making.I’m pleased to announce a new deal between Masdar and RWE……which includes a commitment to jointly invest up to £11 billion into the UK’s new windfarm at Dogger Bank – which will be the biggest in the world.This is a huge boost for UK renewables……creating more jobs……helping to power 3 million homes……and increasing our energy security.And, by the way, this comes just days after we announced £30 billion of investment at our Global Investment Summit… and £21 billion of investment from South Korea.We’ve quite frankly never seen a week like it.In Dubai today, I’ve also had conversations with a range of leaders – including Israel, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan – about the situation in Israel and Gaza.Our position is clear and consistent.We’ve been categorical in our support for Israel’s right to self-defence and to go after the architects of the atrocities of 7th October……while stressing Israel’s obligation to act in line with international humanitarian law.I strongly welcomed the pause in fighting to get hostages out……and we’ve been using the opportunity to get more aid into Gaza.The UK has trebled its aid, but still not enough is getting in via Rafah and other crossings.So we are actively exploring other routes, including by sea.The breakdown of the truce today is deeply disappointing, not least because a growing number of hostages were coming home.I pay tribute to the role of Qatar in helping facilitate these efforts – and I hope the process can be resumed.We want all the hostages released – and in this initial phase all women and children should be freed.I’ve said before that the number of civilian casualties and the scale of the suffering has been far too high.So the return of hostilities is concerning to us all.We’re making it clear that Israel must take maximum care to protect civilian life.We’re opposed to anything that would involve the mass displacement of people.We need to ensure that there are viable designated areas where safety can be guaranteed.And we need to ensure that critical infrastructure like water supplies and hospitals are protected.Again, we’ve been consistent on all of this.So I support the civilian protection plans outlined yesterday by the US Secretary of State.Indeed this has been a central theme in our discussions with regional leaders here, including Israeli President Herzog.Ultimately we will redouble our efforts create a political horizon in which hostages are freed and security, safety and dignity is assured.We will continue to work with our partners to create a lasting peace……beginning with practical steps that address the crisis now.Thank you.",Conservative
Steve Barclay,2023 Speech at the Country Land and Business Association’s Rural Business Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/steve-barclay-2023-speech-at-the-country-land-and-business-associations-rural-business-conference/,"The speech made by Steve Barclay, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, on 30 November 2023.Thank you, Jonathan.It was great to meet with you and with Victoria in my first few days in post and as you just referenced I’m also really pleased to be able to join for my first speech as Secretary of State, here for the CLA Conference.As a rural MP, as someone who lives with his family in the countryside, I know and appreciated, first hand how important our countryside is and I’m delighted to champion the countryside and what it contributes to our country and our way of life.And I know in representing rural communities the CLA brings over 100 years of experience, collective expertise, the sort of first-hand knowledge you don’t acquire behind a Whitehall desk. And I want to listen and learn from that experience as we work together to exercise the greater freedom that we have in setting policy for rural areas.And in particular to empower more, and to burden less, when it comes to running your businesses and taking care of the land.Now, first and foremost when I think about rural communities I think of the essential importance of keeping people fed. And the resilience and food security that we saw was so essential during the Covid pandemic.Farming contributes a whopping £127 billion to the economy. But the importance of farming isn’t just about its economic value, it’s at the heart of meeting our ambitions in terms of targets to tackle climate change, and in terms of making and securing nature and how it can thrive.Now we have many commitments in our National Food Strategy to produce at least 60% of the food we consume, and this was backed up by the Farm to Fork Summit that was held in Downing Street in May after which we published our action plan.And indeed we are investing £2.4 billion a year in England, in the farming sector, with a commitment to maintaining total level of support and helping farmers to be profitable whilst also producing food sustainably and protecting the countryside that we treasure.We’re taking action on things that I know matter to you, such as supporting small abattoirs. And I can confirm that we will be launching our £4 million fund by the end of the year, and we will be working with you to increase fairness in the supply chain.And we have consulted on updating buying standards for public sector food as well, so farmers who are part of our Environmental Land Management schemes should be well placed to benefit from any change that we may announce in the coming months.And I have always been clear that we need to protect our farmers.Indeed as Health Secretary, I blocked a proposal which was to allow schools to impose a vegetarian diet, because to me food is a key part and a valuable sector within the economy, but it is also an important part of our diet too.So as Health Secretary I blocked the proposals which would have allowed the imposition of that in certain schools.Now fundamentally, I want the way we produce food to be sustainable for people and for the planet.And as we leave behind the EU’s bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy, we must continue to make the most of our new found freedoms and to work with farmers – including many in this room – to design and refine new flexible and accessible Environmental Land Management schemes, focusing on Countryside Stewardship and the Sustainable Farming Incentive.We are accepting applications for the expanded and improved Sustainable Farming Incentive with 3,000 now submitted, nearly 2,150 offers now issued and counting, 1,700 now accepted and 800 of you already cracking on.And at Back British Farming Day, we announced that advanced payments of a quarter of the first year’s SFI will be made and indeed have been making their way to bank accounts in October and November, and more will be going out in December too.We have already extended accessibility to ELMs for tenant farmers and we will continue to work with tenant farmers and land owners to identify and remove barriers so that you can work together effectively.That includes allowing farming to continue on historic sites as it has indeed for centuries.And I am delighted to say that an increasing number of farmers are now taking part in our Environmental Land Management schemes, with 32,000 Countryside Stewardship agreements successfully in place across England this year – that is a 94% increase since 2020, and over 6,000 applications have indeed been received this year.I want to confirm that SFI will not be capped, and there is something for everyone – so I encourage all of you to take a look, and apply, if indeed you haven’t already done so.And as these schemes grow, the sector will be increasingly well-placed to benefit from private investment in everything from woodland creation to peatland restoration as we work to reach our target of stimulating at least £500 million of private sector investment into nature recovery in England. That is each year by 2027, with the aim to rise to at least £1bn each year by 2030.And I know that the CLA and many of your members are right at the forefront of this as well.The first two rounds of our Investment Readiness Fund have provided grants of up to £100,000 each, to get 86 nature projects across England to the point that they are ready to attract private capital.It is great that farmers are at the heart of around a quarter of those.Today, I am delighted to launch a third round, that will make a further £5 million available, specifically to support the efforts of farmers and rural businesses, with individual grants of up to £100,000 that will help you to attract investment from the private sector.Applying for one of those grants or schemes does not disbar you from the others – far from it. And our hope is that that they will be mutually reinforcing, as you choose what works best for your business.Today, I want to say a bit more on how we are investing in modern farming techniques, infrastructure, and innovation – alongside support for further research and development.Now this makes a difference to the productivity, to resilience, and in particular to the sustainability of businesses.And when I visited the robotics firm Muddy Machines last week, they showed how the talent of our brightest scientists can unlock a new generation of automation.Where there are barriers stopping game-changing innovations from getting out of labs and onto farms, whether it’s needless regulation or slow grant applications, tearing down those barriers down will be at the heart of my approach.This year, we are investing over £168 million through 16 grant funds.As of this summer, we have committed over £123 million of funding to industry-led research and development for agricultural and horticulture.And today, I am delighted to announce a further £45 million of funding for farming innovation.That includes £30 million to help farmers invest in robotics and automation to make processes like harvesting and milking more efficient, and for the first time, roof-top solar equipment to help improve the sustainability and resilience of your energy supply, and storage to help keep slurry out of our watercourses and bring down emissions.And this follows our announcement of up to £30 million investment for the Genetic Improvement Network at the Farm to Fork summit, building indeed on the £8 million invested over the last five years and the passing of the Genetic Technology Precision Breeding Act.And watch this space for more in 2024 when we will want to see applications for a share of further funding, specifically for testing and trialling the new technology and techniques that we want to see adopted at pace onto farms.All of this will help us make careers in the sector more promising for the next generation who need to be trained up now, it will help maintain our world-leading animal welfare standards, it will strengthen our rural economy, and it will improve our global competitiveness as well.And it’s not just farming that makes a massive difference to our shared prosperity. I know that the rural economy is about so much more than farms – it’s about tourism, hospitality, rural manufacturing, and of course the food sector as a whole.From Scottish salmon and whiskey, to Welsh Lamb, to Northern Ireland beef, to English sparkling wine. Indeed when I was Chief Secretary, I sent an instruction to our embassies that they will serve English sparkling wine not French champagne.Because British food and drink gets a massive vote of confidence from consumers around the world – with exports bringing £24 billion to the British economy, and counting.We have had success stories in opening up new markets including securing access for British lamb to the US.And following our commitments at the Farm to Fork Summit, we are appointing an additional five agri-food attachés to boost the UK’s agri-food exports, bringing the total number of to 16 – with new posts to help unlock key markets in northern Europe, southern Europe, Australia/New Zealand, South Korea, and Africa.They have all just been back to the UK to make sure they are up to speed with the latest plans, and we hope to see progress in the metrics by which we measure export sales in coming months and also to help more rural businesses as they make the leap into exporting.So in conclusion, I just want to say firstly how incredibly impressed I am by the passion and innovation showcased here – and that I will be saying more about the countryside in the months ahead.I will continue to come and see, as I have already been doing, farms and businesses and to listen to you as we refine our schemes, and to seek to make your lives easier.My pledge to you is that this government will always back British farmers who produce some of the highest quality food in the world, who contribute billions to our economy, and to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for taking care of the countryside that they do.So we are forging ahead with our new farming schemes.And in everything we do, our aim is back a profitable and sustainable food and farming sector that supports all that you do, now and for future generations.So, thank you for all that you do, and let us continue to work together. Let’s adopt innovation at pace, lets ensure we back British farmers.Thank you.",Conservative
Esther McVey,2023 Speech on Public Appointments,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/esther-mcvey-2023-speech-on-public-appointments/,"The speech made by Esther McVey, the Cabinet Office Minister, in Edinburgh on 24 November 2023.Good afternoon – it’s a pleasure to be here with you all.This is our third event focused on increasing the diversity of our public appointments……but importantly it’s our first event here in Scotland……and it is also the first Cabinet Office event I’ve been to since arriving in post.And I am pleased to see such a packed room.I want to thank you for taking the time to be here today……we know you are all busy people, with many busy diaries only getting busier in the run-up to Christmas……but it is so important that you’re here.Looking out of the window on my journey up here, I was reminded of the great variety of our country……the rolling hills, the countryside, the towns, the cities.And I thought those places actually represent the diversity of the people who live in those places.And so often, we don’t have that diversity of thought. That diversity of expression in those public bodies.That’s what we’re trying to do today.I’m originally from Liverpool and I lived up in Edinburgh for a while. It’s one of my favourite places. I think it is such a vibrant, exciting place.But the Government – as part of our Levelling Up and Places for Growth agendas – needs to build the better, secure, prosperous future for this country.An important part of my role is being the voice of the people in the very centre of Government……and that means that I need to ensure that this bright future I’ve described for every single citizen across the country.Our UK-wide Public Bodies are a vital part of this work……including those Scottish Arms Length Bodies……and therefore it is essential we get the best – and the right – people in the right posts to run them.And we must all be more strategic about how we go about getting those people for those posts.That’s why I am here today.I’ve been reading about some of the people in this room and I will say that some of the brightest and the best from a real diversity of backgrounds and careers are here today.Baroness Neville-Rolfe – who unfortunately could not be here with us today – told me to really focus on diversity in the broadest sense……that regional diversity and diversity of thought.You can be from different parts of the country, but have the same thought patterns.What we want is that challenge.People bringing that perspective you don’t always hear.Maybe being a bit more thoughtful… a bit more savvy… a bit more concentrated on a local area.And that’s what we intend to do.We want to break that cycle……of what people might describe as group think.And what better place to do that than Scotland, what better place than Edinburgh, to do that.We want to call out to those brilliant people from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Cheshire, Birmingham, Manchester, to spread their expertise across the country.The value of the skills and expertise that people in this room will be priceless……and the expertise you have gained throughout your careers could benefit the public sector.You could help our hospitals be more efficient……you could improve education for the very youngest children……also help those who want to be apprentices……you could ensure some of our greatest museums throughout the country get even better.However it is not only about harnessing those skills…… it’s also about ensuring that candidates for public appointments are drawn from across the breadth of the country.We need diversity – as I said – of thought, of skills, and of capability.Because it’s those sensibilities which will properly challenge the organisations they are responsible for…But before we recognise the scale of the challenge we are doing, we owe it to you and to our public services to make sure the right support is in place.We know that we need to be better throughout the whole process.For example, where applicants may not be successful for a particular appointment – but may be brilliant at what they do – we need to be able to track those people and take that forward, so that maybe we can consider their expertise elsewhere.We should never forget about your career, and ensure there’s career progression offered too.My officials will be on hand today to discuss the upcoming opportunities……and we have a number of departments represented here who – I am sure –  will be delighted to speak to you about roles later today.We have some great speakers today……who will – no doubt – persuade you that this is something you need to go forward for.Whether you’ve got that experience, that certain skill, or what it takes to make a real difference.So I will hand over to the official in the Propriety & Ethics Team at the Cabinet Office……who will tell you what is coming up for the rest of the day.But so you get the best out of today, rather than feeling it’s somebody talking to you or at you……I would like you to be an active participant in what we do.When I do a Q&A session a little bit later, with people who are on boards, who have been on boards, please put your hand up if the questions I’m asking really aren’t the questions you want to ask.Today is really about you.I will also say I’ve been on that journey……I was Chair of the British Transport Police Authority……so I probably know some of the questions you’re thinking:How do I go about it?Is it a closed shop?How do I do my CV?How do I write that covering letter?How do I really sell myself so I can be on that board.I’ve been on this journey too… sometimes unsuccessfully, sometimes successfully.So warts and all, I’ll tell you what it’s been like for me.And also what I’ll say is practice makes perfect.You’ll get into the pattern of how you answer the questions and how you tell your story……so people say “ah, they are the skills that I need on this board.”Hopefully you’ll get a lot out of today, and hopefully you’ll enjoy it.",Conservative
John Glen,2023 Speech to the Transforming Infrastructure Performance Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/john-glen-2023-speech-to-the-transforming-infrastructure-performance-conference/,"The speech made by John Glen, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, on 27 November 2023.Good morning, everyone.It’s a great pleasure to be here with you all today.I don’t think I could have picked a better place to give my first speech as the new Minister for Cabinet Office, because here today, in this audience, at this Live Summit, are the leaders who will create the public sector that we all vitally need – a public sector of the future.I know you’ve all been very busy – in fact this year, we’ve recorded the biggest portfolio of projects on record. I’ve been in post now for 14 days and it was great to sit down with Nick Smallwood last week to discuss his work and understand the challenges and opportunities that he and all of you face.It’s reassuring for me to remember, as a former Treasury minister, that in 2024/25 we are investing 30 billion pounds more in real terms than at the start of this Parliament. In fact, this year we recorded the biggest portfolio of projects on record. two-hundred-and-forty-four to be exact, with an overall worth of eight-hundred-and-five-billion pounds.I want to thank you all for your dedication to this work. Through the teamwork between the public and private sector, we are delivering a vibrant infrastructure, one that will benefit every one of our citizens.Whether it’s nuclear power stations generating clean energy, our prisons rehabilitating offenders giving them a chance to lead a crime-free life, or our hospitals providing critical healthcare, we are delivering for the British public.ChallengesYour delivery is remarkable, not only for the complexity of the task, but for the challenging circumstances you’re delivering these major construction projects through.The Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have created both high inflation and low affordability.But those challenges shouldn’t deter us – on the contrary, they are the reason the projects we work on must be delivered effectively.Public infrastructure plays a vital role in economic growth, and, indeed, it is a growth industry in itself, and we’ll need over a million new workers until 2025 to deliver the projects currently scheduled.So, it is up to government to get those trained workers in place – the apprentices, technicians, graduates – indeed, all skilled workers, and give them the opportunity in this thriving area.But that’s not the only opportunity we’re focused on – no, through the infrastructure you’re building we are embracing new opportunities, to be greener, to be more innovative, to be more modern than ever before.I want to thank the IPA for their leadership here. Their ‘Transforming Infrastructure Performance’ programme describes a vision for the future in which we must prioritise societal outcomes, paving the way for sustainability, digitalisation and modernisation.It’s the right approach to take, and we want to ensure that when people invest in our infrastructure, they’re investing in a revitalised sector. One which can withstand new challenges, adapt to and adopt new technologies, and benefit our citizens and the whole of society.Already our net zero promises are the cornerstone of our New Hospitals Programme and the Schools Rebuilding Programme.These are fantastic new initiatives, and they allow us to put the design and planning innovations to the test.The government will progress the National Infrastructure Commission’s April recommendations on planning by delivering reforms to return the nationally significant infrastructure project regime to the two and a half year average consenting time achieved in 2012.ProductivityThe government will take further action by including the publishing of spatial data on major infrastructure projects for the first time and ensuring a more reliable process for updating national policy statements.As you saw last week in the Chancellor’s remarks at Autumn Statement, we are also taking steps overall in the reform of planning – a new premium planning service, new guaranteed accelerated decision dates, and a critical national priority designation for nationally significant low carbon energy projects, which will also be a helpful intervention. As well, the reforms to the grid connection process, halving the time to build new grid infrastructure.My new boss, The Deputy Prime Minister – and, indeed, my predecessor – spoke about the role that data and AI will play in our public services, and I believe it will have a crucial position in your sector.We have seen how digitalisation is already being used in our infrastructure – the new prison HMP Millsike, for example, has digital and data throughout its processes. Its progress is being tracked in real-time, supply-chain progress and decisions are being digitally recorded. That means reduced cost and reduced risk – time saved and timescales on target.The new prison HMP Fosse Way was also built 22% faster than a traditional build, all thanks to 70% of the project using modern methods of construction.And generative AI was used on HS2 London Tunnels in Euston to shorten the build time by 86 working days, which also saved twelve-million-pounds. Better efficiency, safety and quality was the result – this is what innovation brings.And I’m delighted to say that, next year, the IPA will launch a new benchmarking service to improve decision making, which I hope will lead to stronger business cases and greater confidence in cost and schedules – all powered by innovative practices.ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, now is the time for the UK to be at the forefront of creativity, innovation and a clean future.I passionately believe the new methods this industry has been leading on will not only provide economic stability, it will also provide opportunity throughout our regions, levelling up all public infrastructure to an excellent level.I can promise you that, in my new role, I will always put people at the very heart of our projects, whether that is the taxpayer or business leaders, whether in a big city or a small town.I want to reiterate my thanks to all of you – yes, we are aware of the challenges ahead of us, but I believe we have an ever more sophisticated plan to tackle them.I look forward to a future where our TIP principles not only create thriving UK towns and cities, but are used as an example of how to create world-leading infrastructure.And I look forward to working with you to make those ambitions – your ambitions, our ambitions – a reality.I wish you well with your conference today and with the workshops that you will be doing later this morning.

Rishi Sunak,2023 Speech at the Global Investment Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-speech-at-the-global-investment-summit/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, at 10 Downing Street on 27 November 2023.“Good morning.Welcome to Hampton Court Palace and the UK’s second Global Investment Summit.Now, my argument today is that the UK is a modern, dynamic, thriving economy.And where better to prove those futuristic credentials, than a 500-year-old Palace.But this Summit is not just a sales pitch for Britain……although you’d better believe I’m going to give you that.It’s also a chance for us to say: thank you.I’ve spent my career before politics in business and finance.And so have many of my top team, including the Chancellor.And we know that it’s not governments that grow the economy.It’s businesses and investors like all of you.You create jobs; drive growth; generate wealth…… and you even take on some of the biggest social challenges we face.And it may be unfashionable to say……but I believe that your success is our country’s success.So I really am grateful to all of you for making time to be here today.And your presence……your decision to choose to invest in Britain……is a huge vote of confidence in this country’s future.And I think you’re absolutely right to feel that confidence.Because we’re setting about to make this best place in the world to invest and do business.Now I am unashamedly proud of Britain.Ands there’s a growing momentum in the UK right now.Don’t just take my word for it.PWC’s survey of thousands of global CEOs rated the UK the most attractive investment destination in Europe.And you can see that confidence in the decisions people are making.Like Tata, BMW, and just last week, Nissan – investing billions into automotive and electric vehicles manufacturing.Or Microsoft, announcing today £2.5bn for critical AI infrastructure……in addition to all the leading AI labs who already have their European offices here.Or the Ellison Institute of Technology, confirming today a £1bn investment into their new Oxford site..…researching and developing new technologies, including life sciences.And you can see that momentum too in our commitment to free trade.In the past year alone, we’ve secured new investment partnerships with the US, Japan, and South Korea……worth more than £50bn.We’ve become the first European country to join the fast-growing Trans-Pacific partnership…And hugely benefited from the sovereign investment partnership with the United Arab Emirates……deploying over £14bn into the UK in a little over two years.And all of that is why this country is one of the fastest [for] investment growth… anywhere in the G7Now when I say this country can be the best place in the world to invest and do business……you should believe me and believe me because of three big competitive advantages.Our low tax approach; our culture of innovation; and our people.Firstly, tax.The purest expression of this government’s economic philosophy……is that people and businesses make far better decisions about their own money……than any government could.And I believe that by allowing you to keep more of the return on your capital……our country becomes more competitive as a place to invest, grow, and create jobs.And make no mistake, we are cutting taxes.Not only do we have the lowest rate of Corporation Tax rate in the G7.Last week, we announced that we would make full expensing, permanent.This means you can write off the cost of many capital investments – in full.It makes our capital allowances regime one of the most generous in the world.And it was the biggest business tax cut in modern British history.And that’s not all.We’ve got lower capital gains tax rates than France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.Some of the most generous tax reliefs on stock options anywhere in the world.And we’re cutting personal taxes for 27 million working people, too.But while low taxes are crucial, they’re not enough on their own……to make this country the best investment destination in the world.We’re also creating new ideas……and turning those ideas into the most exciting companies of the future.And that’s the UK’s second competitive advantage: our incredible culture of innovation.Now the story of the United Kingdom has always been about discovery and invention.Ours is the country of Newton, Faraday, Hodgkin, and Lovelace……of Stephenson’s steam engine, Darwin’s theory of evolution……and the world wide web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee……who I’m delighted is attending here today.And that tradition is still very much alive.With less than 1% of the world’s population, we have three of the world’s top 10 universities.The third highest number of research publications.And the second most Nobel laureates of any nation.And we’re turning those ideas into incredible businesses, up and down the country.With more tech Unicorns than any country, bar the US and China.And more venture capital than France and Germany combined.Not that I’m in any way competitive.But at a moment like this, when the tectonic plates of technology are shifting……not just in AI, but in quantum, synthetic biology, semiconductors, and much more……we cannot be complacent.And that’s why we’re investing record amounts of public capital into R&D.Also Cutting taxes for all of you that are investing in R&D.And overhauling our listing rules to make it easier for those innovative growing companies to raise capital.And outside the EU, we’re delivering agile regulation that is pro-innovation and pro-growth.So, whether it’s financial services or life sciences……AgriTech or our creative industries……innovation is the golden thread running through the British economy.But in the end, the greatest asset to any economy is its people.And that’s the UK’s third competitive advantage.Here at home, we’re delivering a world-class education system.We’ve already got one of the most highly qualified workforces in Europe.And just as your businesses are having to adapt to the economy of the future, so our skills policies are evolving too……with our new Lifetime Skills Guarantee, …which supports adults to retrain at any stage in their careers……with record funding in vocational training like apprenticeships.But we don’t have a monopoly on talent in this country.And we recognise that nearly half of our most innovative companies have an immigrant founder.So if you’re an innovator, an entrepreneur, a researcher,…you should know that the most competitive visa regime for highly skilled international talent……is right here in the United Kingdom.And let me give you just one example:Our High Potential Individual visa means…That if you’re a young person…Who’s graduated from a global top 50 university…You can just come to the UK…And stay here, with your family, for two years…To just explore. Work. Study. Invent.Nothing like that exists anywhere else in the world.And that tells you everything about our pro-innovation, pro-growth, pro-business philosophy:So that’s the opportunity here in the UK.That’s why you should believe me when I say……this is the best country in the world to invest and do business.Because of that unique combination of a competitive tax system…Our culture of innovation…And our people.Now I know some people look at Summits like this and often they’re all talking shops.But let me tell you what we’ve achieved.This Summit has galvanised new investments in the UK economy……worth a total of [almost] £30bn, over three times as much as the first Summit that was held a couple of years ago.That will support tens of thousands of new jobs right across the UK.It will create new growth and new opportunities.And it’s a huge vote of confidence in this country’s future.So, thank you for choosing to be part of that future.Thank you for everything you’re doing for this country.with your support……we can and we will build an even brighter future……for our children and grandchildren.Thank you.",Conservative

Kemi Badenoch,2023 Speech at the Global Investment Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/kemi-badenoch-2023-speech-at-the-global-investment-summit/,"The speech made by Kemi Badenoch, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, at Hampton Court on 27 November 2023.Good morning Ladies & Gentlemen and welcome to the 2023 Global Investment Summit.Thank you to everyone who has travelled from across the globe to be here today to mark the next chapter in this country’s future.Two years ago at our inaugural Global Investment Summit, we were still in the throes of a pandemic, yet investors put a near £10 billion vote of confidence in our country because they saw the huge potential for growth that we had to offer.It sowed the seeds for our hugely successful Northern Ireland Investment Summit in September which put Belfast and Northern Ireland firmly on the global boardroom map.And as a growing science and technology superpower, the Prime Minister held our first-ever AI Summit earlier this month to ensure the UK is at the forefront of a pioneering world of artificial intelligence.Now, it won’t come as news for many of you in this room, but the UK is already a fantastic place to invest. That’s why you’re here.We are now third in the world for total inward investment, currently standing at $2.7 trillion, and are the top destination in Europe for FDI projects. We have attracted more greenfield FDI than Germany and France combined.We also have the most valuable tech sector, only the third in the world to reach $1 trillion in value.Last year alone we created 112,000 jobs in all corners of the UK from inward investment, with many more being created here today.Since the Department for Business & Trade was formed just a few months ago, we have seen even greater investment in this country.In my first few days as Business Secretary, I ushered in a momentous deal for Airbus and Rolls-Royce providing new aircraft for Air India.In September, BMW announced a transformation of their Oxford Mini plant which secured 4,000 jobs, with Stellantis pledging £100 million for electric vehicles at Ellesmere Port.Our investment minister Lord Johnson signed a £10 billion MoU with Marubeni just last month for green projects.Tata Group have pledged £4 billion to create a new gigafactory site in Somerset which will transform our battery supply chains and create thousands of jobs.And last week, we saw £21 billion of Korean investment in renewable energy, life sciences and tech during the South Korea State Visit.And on Friday we secured £2 billion from Nissan for their sites in Sunderland, which will help secure thousands of jobs.And that’s not to mention the global leadership we are showing in free and fair trade.Such as joining the CPTPP trading bloc, ushering in our first post-Brexit free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, and unlocking £6.5 billion of fresh export opportunities across 75 markets in the last year alone.We’re also taking huge steps to ensure that the UK’s manufacturing sector is a world leader in innovation.Yesterday I launched our £3 billion Advanced Manufacturing Plan which will invest in the long-term future of our innovative manufacturing industry by reducing costs and removing barriers to business.This comes off the back of the UK’s manufacturing sector leapfrogging France to become the eighth biggest in the world.But we cannot stand still. The world is changing fast, and the global economy is a very competitive place.Just months ago our historic trade deal with Australia came into force – since then we’ve secured £10 billion from IFM Investors and £5 billion from Aware Super to turbocharge green transition, infrastructure, tech and life science projects, as well as £100 million from Patrizia for sustainable housing projects.As part of a total £12 billion programme, Ibedrola have today confirmed £7 billion for our world-leading renewables sector, with Partner Groups’ portfolio companies North Star and Gren committing £1 billion and £500 million for new offshore wind infrastructure and community energy projects respectively.And the UK tech scene continues its world-leading charge, with combined investments totalling nearly £6 billion from Microsoft, BioNTech, Yondr, the Ellison Institute, Aira, Oxford Quantum Circuits and MediaTek.These investments total nearly £30 billion – a colossal vote of confidence in the UK, proving further how we are one of the best places in the world to invest.But I want to take this further.I want the UK to be even more innovative, even more dynamic and even more successful. I want business to look at the UK and see it as a dynamo for investment, free trade and growth.I have said that my door is always open. My office is called the Department for Business.I want your ideas on how we can create a more friendly common-sense regulatory environment; what things we should be doing differently rather than sticking to the status quo.I want to move away from just seeing regulation as the solution, and focus instead on solving your problems.The numbers speak for themselves, and at today’s summit you will see why we’re already on the path to even greater things.I’m delighted to welcome the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, to the stage to tell us more.",Conservative
Steve Barclay,2023 Speech at the International Grain Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/steve-barclay-2023-speech-at-the-international-grain-conference/,"The speech made by Steve Barclay, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 25 November 2023.Thank you to President Zelenskyy for hosting this important summit.To say that we Brits have been inspired by the resilience, courage and indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people would be a typically British understatement.Your resilience honours the memory of the millions of innocent Ukrainians who lost their lives in the Holodomor – some 90 years ago.And now, while Russia’s full-scale invasion is having a ripple effect on global food security – nowhere have the impacts of Putin’s aggression been felt more keenly than here, in Ukraine.In the wake of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam this summer, that left tens of thousands of Ukrainians in need of food, water, and basic supplies, I am proud that the UK was able to provide additional £16m of support – including response teams, pumps, and temporary barriers, that helped Ukrainian emergency workers deflect water and protect critical infrastructure like hospitals and schools.Of course, flooding across 100,000 hectares land has had an untold impact on Ukraine’s wildlife and habitats, and on important grain and oil crops as well.And amid the turmoil of war, the determination of Ukrainian farmers to get much of the harvest in, here in the breadbasket of Europe and your initiative to get the grain from Ukraine to some of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world, at a time when Ukrainians themselves are suffering so much – this demonstrates the very best of humanity.And indeed, this work is immensely and increasingly important.Even before this terrible conflict began,  already, the number of people going hungry was on the rise – with around a billion people affected worldwide.The number of people facing the consequences of severe drought – including conflict – is on the rise as well, with the impact of emergencies across the Horn of Africa and the Central Sahel falling disproportionately women and girls.45 million children now suffer from acute malnutrition at any given time – and this preventable, life-threatening condition remains one of the biggest contributors to childhood deaths.That means children under five are succumbing to common childhood illnesses that a well-nourished child would fend off, and simply wasting away, bringing profound and lasting impacts for the rest of their lives. So, I want to thank the Government of Ukraine for bringing us together to help change that.Putin’s efforts to pitch us against one another must fail, and let us be clear – that is exactly what he wants to do.The Black Sea Grain Initiative had enabled the export of 33 million tonnes of food from Ukraine, to 45 countries around the world – and until this summer, the World Food Programme procured 80% of its global wheat grain from Ukraine.Yet as well as scuppering that initiative in July, Putin has attacked Ukrainian civilian grain and port infrastructure – systematically destroying more grain in attacks on Ukrainian ports than Putin promised to donate to African countries, with some 280,000 tonnes of grain gone, and counting – that is enough to feed over a million people, for a year –  inflating global grain prices to boost the value of Russian exports and line the Kremlin’s coffers.And all for the sake propping up Russia’s murderous war machine.So much for solidarity. In the face of Putin’s crocodile tears – our focus remains resolutely on the real solutions we need.That is why the £2m Grain Verification Scheme is part of the work that the UK has led through the G7 – to help identify stolen grain and frustrate Russia’s efforts to profit from theft.The UK Ministry of Defence is working to establish a comprehensive Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance operation in the Black Sea – to deter Russian attacks on cargo vessels.We have developed an innovative insurance facility with a UK insurer for ships using Ukraine’s humanitarian corridor to help scale up exports.And I am proud that the UK was the first country to liberalise all tariffs on imports of Ukrainian goods in support of your economy as well – alongside our wider commitments at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London earlier summer.Our Prime Minster, Rishi Sunak, has announced £3m for the World Food Programme – building on our earlier contributions to President Zelenskyy’s initiative.This time last year, the UK contributed £5m to this scheme, which funded the delivery of 25,000 tonnes of grain to Kenya.Together, contributions from all donors to the scheme have brought 170,000 tonnes of relief to communities in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen.The UK’s contribution of £3m – which equates to $3.7m – will fund a shipment that will get grain from Ukraine, to those who are suffering from acute food insecurity in Nigeria, taking the UK’s total military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine to £9.6bn, since the start of the invasion.In short, the British people continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with you, here in Ukraine, and with those affected around the world, and if we all continue to stand together – in defence of the freedom, democracy, and common decency that we treasure so deeply – then together, we will prevail.Thank you.",Conservative

Of course, we want to see all hostages released immediately and families affected by the horrors of the October 7th terror attack reunited.This pause provides an important opportunity to ensure much greater volumes of food, fuel and other life-saving aid can reach Gaza on a sustained basis. We have already doubled our aid commitment to Palestinians this year and will work closely with the UN to ensure it reaches those who need it.The UK will continue to work with all partners in the region to secure the release of all hostages, restore security and reach a long-term political solution which enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace.",Conservative
Stuart Andrew,2023 Speech at the Bacta Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/stuart-andrew-2023-speech-at-the-bacta-annual-conference/,"The speech made by Stuart Andrew, the Gambling Minister, on 22 November 2023.Good morning. I am delighted to join you today ahead of a wide ranging discussion about the future of the arcade and amusement sector.I want to start by telling you something that of course you already know: the economic benefits of the arcade and amusement sector are huge. The sector produces a collective economic turnover of £1.6 billion and supports thousands of jobs across the United Kingdom.From the arcades supporting our high streets and seaside towns, to the single site operators and manufacturers, all of these play a significant role in supporting employment and helping our local economies thrive.Our white paper, which we published earlier this year, recognised the importance of the sector. It outlined our ongoing commitment to supporting you after a challenging few years following COVID-19 and rising energy prices. We hope that the measures we are taking will enable the sector to continue to operate sustainably now and over the coming years.I recognise the commercial challenges you are facing, and I believe that the modernising measures we are taking will help to support that move towards a brighter future.Many of you here today will be keen to understand the progress we have made on the land-based gambling proposals set out in that white paper.Last month we closed the government’s land-based gambling consultation, which included our proposals for the reform of the 80/20 rule, the introduction of direct cashless payments on gaming machines, and our commitment to introducing an age limit on ‘cash out’ Category D slot style machines – something which I know Bacta members already adhere to.The consultation sought views on a range of policy proposals, which were designed to support the arcade and amusement sector. I would like to personally thank all of you who have responded. The evidence you supplied is essential for ensuring that government policy is evidence-led, and takes into account the real world impact that these policies will have on the day-to-day operations of your businesses.I would also like to thank Bacta for their continued engagement throughout the consultation process. By bringing together a diverse range of voices, and representing its members so effectively, Bacta is able to provide valuable insight to us. This provides us with the confidence that we are hearing the views of the sector as a whole.In terms of the proposals themselves, I appreciate that many of you will be eager to understand what happens next. I am afraid that you will need to wait a little longer for the government response to confirm our chosen policy direction.However, I would like to reiterate that the intention behind all of our proposals is to ensure that industry can operate sustainably now and into the future, whilst also ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect the minority of customers who experience gambling related harm.I would especially like to thank the Gambling Commission and local licensing authorities for their work in creating a regulatory environment which minimises the risk of gambling related harm, making Great Britain one of the world leaders when it comes to standards.I understand Andrew Rhodes will be speaking to you later today and I am sure he will be getting a bit of a grilling, as I am sure I am.I know that the reform of the 80/20 rule is of significant interest to many of you here today.Our white paper and consultation recognised that the 80/20 ratio of low to medium stake gaming machines is no longer fit for purpose.We fully recognise that you believe that this current ratio does not allow you to meet customer demand, and that this has led to the maintenance of large numbers of machines, which are underused but energy intensive. This situation is undesirable for both businesses and the consumer.We therefore proposed to modernise this ratio to better reflect customer demand. But we have a responsibility to ensure that customers are presented with a genuine offer of lower stake gambling opportunities in order to maintain a safe gambling environment.To help inform decision making around commercial flexibility and a genuinely balanced product offer, we have sought additional evidence. This includes the consultation as well as an industry data request concerning the use and functionality of different categories of machines. My department and I are extremely grateful to Bacta and other trade bodies for their willingness in sharing such evidence. The data we have received will help ensure that our policies continue to be evidence led, and we will consider it alongside the consultation responses to arrive at a balanced and measured solution.I appreciate the concerns that John has raised regarding Option 2 and the strong views that have been expressed about this proposal. That is why, in part, to make this policy a success, it has been essential to gather a wider range of evidence through a rigorous consultation process. That is why we also consulted on removing the 80/20 rule entirely. This process will provide us with the confidence that our policy changes will deliver on the white paper priorities of modernising the sector, while maintaining appropriate safeguards against gambling harm.I am sure many of you will be pleased to see that the government has committed to allowing cashless payments to be made on gaming machines.Payment methods have shifted substantially in recent years, with many customers on the high street no longer carrying cash as they used to. Having visited Novomatic and Merkur’s high street arcade venues in Hammersmith, I appreciate that there are ways for customers to use their card through things like ticket-in-ticket-out machines.However, the current prohibition on the direct use of debit cards on machines is out of step with how people expect to be able to pay for things. The ability to use debit cards on gaming machines is a necessary modernisation to ensure that the sector is able to keep up with changing consumer preferences.As you will appreciate, such a significant transition will not be achieved overnight. There will be technical challenges that manufacturers and operators will need to work through together.However, we will set out a framework of minimum standards that must be adhered to if a machine is to accept direct cashless payments. Central to this framework is the need to ensure strong player protections are in place to safeguard against gambling harm.The evidence provided through consultation has been extremely helpful in shaping our thoughts on this and we will set out more details in the government’s response to the consultation.The final measure which I would like to touch on is our commitment to introducing an age limit on ‘cash out’ Category D slot style machines. This measure is essential for ensuring that children and young people are not exposed to the risks associated with underage gambling.As Bacta members, I would like to thank all of you for leading the way on this issue. The voluntary ban undertaken by Bacta members on under 18s in 2021 was an important step forward.We are now legislating on this to ensure that all venues, including those outside of the Bacta membership, adhere to these standards.I am aware that some of you have expressed concerns about any potential requirement that these machines may be moved to an age-restricted area. I would like to reassure you that we have made no such proposal to do this. We recognise the value of maintaining these machines on the floors of Family Entertainment Centres for the use of adults, while their children enjoy penny pushers and the various other amusements that these venues have to offer.I am sure many of you are keen for further clarity on the measures and an understanding of the timelines for implementation. My officials are currently analysing the responses submitted through consultation. We intend to publish the government’s response in early 2024, which will outline our precise policy direction on all of these issues.All of the measures outlined above will require secondary legislation, and we intend to take the necessary steps to implement these measures by summer 2024. As with all secondary legislation, these timelines will be dependent on parliamentary time.In addition to the land-based consultation, we also recently launched a consultation on the statutory levy, the third consultation that we committed to delivering in the white paper.The introduction of the statutory levy is an important counterpart to the broader suite of regulatory protections we and the Gambling Commission are implementing. While we would all agree that we want to prevent harm before it occurs, it is also crucial that the public has access to the right help if and when they might need it, and that regulation is informed by quality and timely research.I want to see increased, independent, sustainable funding to be directed where it is needed most. This will ensure that people across our country can make informed decisions about their gambling and know where to turn for support should they need it. We have proposed a levy rate of 0.1% to be paid by land-based arcades, which is less than the rate proposed for online gambling operators, betting shops and casinos. We believe that this is proportionate approach and should not place undue burden on the sector.As for the manufacturers, single-site operators and distributors, I understand your concern regarding the proposed 0.4% levy rate. The legislation is clear that the levy needs to be paid by all those with a licence. However, we want the structure to be clear, fair and proportionate. We are keen to hear from industry and will take all evidence we receive into consideration when making a final decision.That consultation closes on 14 December and, if you haven’t done already, I encourage you all to submit a response.Thank you once again for inviting me to speak today, and I hope that the rest of today’s discussions are productive. I hope that in my time as the Minister I have shown that my door is open and it will remain open as we continue to deliver what I hope will be the right policies for a sustainable future.I will now be joined by Sarah Fox, DCMS’s Deputy Director for Gambling and Lotteries. We would be very happy to take any questions you may have about the gambling review and the measures the government is taking to support the sector.",Conservative
Robert Halfon,2023 Speech to the UUK Mental Health Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-halfon-2023-speech-to-the-uuk-mental-health-conference/,"The speech made by Robert Halfon, the Higher Education Minister, in London on 21 November 2023.Thank you, Edward (Peck), and to Universities UK for the opportunity to speak at this important conference.The World Health Organisation defines good mental health as:‘a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community’Every single part of that definition has relevance to students’ time at university. But particularly having sufficient mental wellbeing to realise their abilities and learn well.Students cannot fulfil their potential, and study for a degree on which to build future success, if their wellbeing is unsupported. Mental ill health is not something students should be expected to push through or attempt to ignore – because we all know that can lead to tragic consequences. Today is about confronting this – and examining what more can be done to help students thrive.I’d like to begin by paying tribute to all the student services staff who work on the frontline, day in, day out, to support students. You are there for them on their hardest days at university. You strive to help them find a way through. You do it because you care – because you want the best for your students.You, more than anyone, will be aware that increasing numbers of students are needing support.In 2022, 23% more students declared mental health conditions when they applied through UCAS. It takes bravery to ‘own up’ to an ongoing mental health issue when you’re about to embark on a new stage of your life, hoping to make new friends, and perhaps even present a new version of yourself. We need to reward this bravery by ensuring the support is there when they arrive at university.So on an individual level, mental health support for students is important for their personal academic success.But I think it’s important on a societal level too. I see mental health not just as a personal issue, but a matter of social justice. It’s about making sure the opportunity to enter, thrive and graduate from university is open to everyone with the ability to do so.We know that today poor mental health reduces the chance of progressing to a graduate job or further study. This shouldn’t be the case. No one should be held back from achieving in higher education because of their background or personal challenges. When we create the right conditions for good mental health, we are in turn allowing students to climb the Ladder of Opportunity to sustainable employment and prosperity.This is clear progress. But I know you don’t want to sit back and rest on your laurels, and that is why you are here today.Because we have all been deeply affected by the loss of bright, capable and loved young people to suicide at university.And we owe it to the memories of those we have lost to take strong and effective action to prevent further tragedies.In my year as Minister for Higher Education I have made this an absolute priority. There are 3 pillars to our approach:Funding vital services and projects; spreading and implementing best practice; and clear responsibilities for providers and protection for students.The first pillar is about investing in the wellbeing of students.To provide nationwide access to free mental health resources and confidential support, we provided Student Minds with £3.6 million to set up Student Space. Over 450,000 students have now benefitted from this service, including those who recently braved the “freshers” experience.Those early stages of university life bring new opportunities, but also new responsibilities, and the transition isn’t always easy. We are backing university wellbeing services to support these students as part of this year’s £15 million investment in mental health by the Office for Students (OfS).Of course it’s not just about the level of investment, but about being clear-headed on which interventions will genuinely transform students’ lives. And that’s why the launch of TASO’s (Transforming Access and Student Outcomes in Higher Education) Student Mental Health Evidence Hub last month couldn’t have been more timely. As part of our grant to the OfS, it’s the first step towards understanding ‘what really works’ in higher education settings so we can make timely and effective interventions to help students, rather than let problems escalate. You will hear more about this in the afternoon.One thing you have told us needs to work better is the join-up between university services and the NHS. I want us to be in a position where a student comes into hospital, and the doctor already knows if that student has seen a university wellbeing officer.That’s why the OfS has brought together higher education (HE) providers and NHS trusts across each region in England to address the challenges of joined-up working. It’s about having a single clear view of a student across universities and the NHS so they have a smooth experience of transitioning between services. The outputs of this work are due to be shared by the OfS in the coming weeks.The NHS mental health care services that many students rely on are already benefitting from an additional £2.3 billion a year, through the NHS Long Term Plan.And the government has gone further, with guaranteed increases through the Mental Health Investment Standard that have brought our total investment to nearly £16 billion in 2022/2023.Our second pillar is about best practice.We need to create the right conditions on campus for students to thrive through a whole-university approach to mental health. This means not just relying on student wellbeing services. It means everyone, from the Vice Chancellor down to the librarian takes responsibility for creating an environment and culture that supports positive mental health and wellbeing.The principles for achieving this are laid out in the University Mental Health Charter. This importantly includes the principle that good staff wellbeing should be supported, recognising the challenges those in the room face on a day-to-day basis.The associated Charter Programme supports providers to embed these important principles and follow a process of continuous improvement as they work towards the Charter Award. It is already raising standards within the sector.Thanks to the hard work of university staff, and the backing of your leaders, you have delivered an incredible 50% increase in University Mental Health Charter Programme membership over the summer. We’re now at 96 universities, which is a big step – perhaps even a giant leap – closer to our target of all universities joining by September 2024.This is the cornerstone of our plan to improve student mental health. I am fully committed to reaching the full target and providing support for the fantastic Student Minds to see it through.We also owe a lot to Universities UK. By working closely with charities and experts, it has made great strides in recent years in developing clear mental health support frameworks. And I would like to pay tribute to John de Pury who has led the charge on mental health for UUK so valiantly and who I know is coming to the end of his time in post this week.To capitalise on this progress, I wrote to university leaders in June to ask them to take ownership of mental health at an executive level. The sector needs to come together to finish the job of embedding the guidance that has been set out.Just a reminder about why we need to do this – why it’s so important:Callum Dineen wrote to me last month about the tragic case of his friend, Theo Brennan-Hulme, who took his life at the University of  East Anglia.Callum had a simple ask:That universities have clear information-sharing policies to protect students and prevent further tragedies, following the UUK Trusted Contacts guidance. That families are given the chance to step in and provide much needed help to their loved ones.This was a powerful campaign, with strong support from cross-party MPs – which I wholeheartedly supported.I now want to turn to the work of Professor Edward Peck, and take this opportunity to thank him for all the progress he has made since his appointment as HE Student Support Champion. This summer I asked Edward to build on that work and chair the Higher Education Mental Health Implementation Taskforce – a vehicle for delivering real change.Firstly, the taskforce is developing a plan for effectively identifying students who need university wellbeing support, so no one falls through the cracks. This needs to include greater data sharing as students make the transition from schools or college to university. There is the opportunity here for exploring whether UCAS could widen the breadth and depth of information collected on mental health.Secondly, the taskforce will ensure there is accountability and transparency around the adoption of best practice.Thirdly, it will develop a ‘student commitment’, so that students are dealt with sensitively when they face course dismissal or receive difficult assignment results.I was delighted to open the inaugural taskforce meeting in July. I saw common cause across a group bringing together different parts of the higher education sector, with Professor Steve West representing UUK, as well as health services, the charity sector, and – crucially – students and parents.The recently appointed FE Support Champion, Polly Harrow, will shortly be invited to join the taskforce to ensure we are joining-up our approach across colleges and universities.The taskforce will conclude its work in May next year, providing an interim update in early 2024.In recent months I have had the privilege to speak directly to families who have lost loved ones to suicide. I have been humbled by their strength and determination to prevent further tragedies, whilst facing the most unimaginable pain and loss. We stand with these families.This Government has pledged to reduce suicide rates within five years – with young people, including students, a priority group. We have set out over 100 actions to meet this pledge as part of our comprehensive Suicide Prevention Strategy.This includes learning lessons from suicides that have occurred in universities. We will do this through a National Review of Higher Education Student Suicides.We are looking to appoint an organisation with the expertise and track record to deliver this important review and we hope to announce further details very shortly.I’m sure the sector will embrace this review as a positive endeavour to do better by students. Serious incident reviews will be submitted on an anonymised basis, using UUK’s postvention guidance template.We have heard the heartfelt stories from families and friends who have lost loved ones. All eyes are now on those who have the power to make a real difference to students’ wellbeing.I will be hosting a roundtable with HE leaders at Leeds Trinity University later this week to discuss how we can answer this call to action.As I’ve said before, I am confident we have a strong plan in place, but I don’t rule out going further if needs be. If we do not see the improvements we need, I will not hesitate to ask the Office for Students to look at introducing a new registration condition on mental health.Ultimately, we must do what it takes to provide the safety net that students and their loved ones expect and deserve as they embark on the amazing privilege of university life.",Conservative
Andrew Mitchell,2023 Speech to the Global Food Security Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/andrew-mitchell-2023-speech-to-the-global-food-security-summit/,"The speech made by Andrew Mitchell, the Minister for Africa and Development, at the Global Food Security Summit in London on 20 November 2023.Ladies and gentlemen, Your Excellencies, friends.This is the first of 4 sessions that I mentioned entitled ‘Creating new approaches to ending preventable deaths of children’. And we’ve got here for the session some of the best minds in the world for tackling this subject. We’ve got an hour and a half to try to make real progress and I want to thank everyone in advance for focusing so hard on this vital subject.We know that too many children are going to bed hungry and malnourished. It’s a point the Prime Minister set out right at the beginning of his remarks. And we are here united in our determination to change that – bringing all your expertise and experience to bear.And as you know, we launched theUK international development white papertoday, setting out our long-term vision for addressing critical global challenges. This includes preventing and treating child wasting, through new partnerships and sources of finance.The collective effort to produce the white paper drew on the most expert minds in the business, including charities andNGOs, the private sector, academia and our partners abroad. It’s been an enormous undertaking, and I am hugely grateful to those of you who shared your expertise.This morning we are bringing that expertise together again, with a focus on child malnutrition.This summit is an important opportunity to galvanise action, shifting the dial to do more on prevention. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on how we can enhance preventative measures, build resilience and optimise funding, in order to have the biggest impact.A huge part of this will be vital scientific research. We’ve already seen some big breakthroughs over the years, with ready-to-use foods like plumpy nut, for managing child wasting in the community. This ground-breaking work dramatically reduced the need for inpatient care, increased the uptake of treatment and saved countless lives across the world.We need more breakthroughs like this. That’s why the Foreign Office is supporting an ambitious research programme throughELRHA, to build a package of evidence-based interventions in nutrition, health, water and sanitation.We are also proud of our work together with UNICEF. Since we launched our partnership three years ago to drive progress on child wasting, UNICEF has recorded some impressive results in the 9 targeted countries.Last year, more than 4 million children were reached with essential nutrition support like Vitamin A, a 60% increase on the year before. And the proportion of children given lifesaving treatment for severe wasting increased from a third in 2021 to nearly half last year. We are continuing our work together with UNICEF to catalyse more sustainable financing, build stronger supply chains and help prevent, detect and treat child wasting.I am also delighted to announce that we will extend this fantastic partnership to 2030, the year when the white paper ends, and double our funding with an additional nearly £31 million bringing the total to £61 million.We will be working with UNICEF and our partners, including many of you here today, to campaign for action to reach at least 350 million mothers and children with services to prevent, detect and treat child wasting in the hardest hit regions of the world. Now I am delighted today to be co-chairing this session with UNICEF’s Deputy Executive Director, Omar Abdi, and I am looking forward to hearing from him very shortly.We are also working together with the World Health Organisation and World Food Programme to strengthen the evidence for preventing and treating child wasting. TheWHOis today launching new guidelines, including, for the first time, on prevention. And I am delighted thatWHODirector General Tedros is with us this morning and I am looking forward to hearing from him.We are committed to implementing these guidelines and supporting you, our partners, to do the same.As the Prime Minister announced this morning, the new funding for UNICEF includes a further £16 million for the Child Nutrition Fund, which we are inaugurating this morning alongside our partners, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, where we had that fantastic announcement by Sir Chris Hohn of his additional $50 million.This is not just a UK-UNICEF partnership. It is, crucially, a partnership with the 10 countries that have joined us in using the Child Nutrition Fund Match-window to double supplies of therapeutic food within their health systems. And we hope more countries will join them.I’m glad that Pakistan’s minister of health, Nadeem Jan, is with us, and we look forward to hearing more about this from him.It is clear there is a great deal of expertise and determination in this room, so let us use this session, and this summit, to inspire each other to reach greater heights, save lives, and build a healthier future for the world’s children.Thank you very much indeed.",Conservative
David Cameron,2023 Speech to the Global Food Security Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/david-cameron-2023-speech-to-the-global-food-security-summit/,"The speech made by David Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, in London on 20 November 2023.Thank you ladies and gentleman and thank you Andrew. A week into my new job and I am delighted this is my first speaking engagement because it is an issue that really matters.Thank you to Andrew Mitchell for bringing us here. Thank you to the Somalian President who I met with this morning for his attendance today and thank you to the UAE, our friends in the Emirates for being our co-hosts. And an apology, I am meant to be teaching a course in Abu Dhabi at New York University in January and I’ve had to cancel that because of my new role but I was very much looking forward to another stay in your remarkable country.And of course thank you to the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for their support. It is so good to be back working with you again on these sorts of issues that matter so much.This government has a proud record on development and I am proud of what we did on development and I am determined that we put development right back at the heart of our Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, it is so important.You have had a long day, with lots of speeches. I have had an extraordinary day going to the House of Lords, doing all the right things, and nodding and saying yes and all the rest of it. So I’ll go home and tell Mrs Cameron she is now Lady Cameron, she’s absolutely furious about that. That is what happened to me today but you have had a long day and had lots of speeches so I just want to make 4 simple points.The first is what you have been doing today and talking about today, food security, really matters. I believe in all theSDGs– indeed, I was part of the committee that helped do the original work drawing them up. I care about all of them, but food is foundational to all aspects of development.Without secure access to a nutritious diet, nothing can be achieved. And malnourished children can never fully develop their bodies and minds, and it robs them of their futures and it robs their societies of their potential.The number of people facing acute food insecurity is the highest it has been in years. And this is just the tip of what I have called a ‘silent crisis’, with a third of the world unable to afford a healthy diet.So I promise you this today – the UK will continue to lead efforts like this.Now it is great to speak after Minister Dias as Brazil takes on the G20 Presidency. As Prime Minister, I hosted with Brazil summits on Hunger and Nutrition for Growth in 2012 and 2013. Together, we galvanised global action. It was more money invested in better outcomes and that’s what needed again.Second, this is an absolutely critical moment. Not just because this silent crisis is growing. But because we cannot separate it from other global crises.Putin’s illegal invasion brought this home, as he deliberately sought to rob us of one of the world’s great bread baskets. His cynicism was plain for all to see. He obstructed the Black Sea Grain Initiative. He then walked away from it. He then tried to destroy the very supplies that the world needs.ButI saw for myself, in Ukraine, in the Port of Odessa, there is good news. Ukraine is pushing Russia back in the Black Sea. And with the new Unity Facility between UK insurance brokers and the government in Kyiv, shipping insurance for their food exports is affordable once more.So let the message go out. Ships are sailing, grain is being exported, Ukraine will continue to help feed us all.Third point, there is a vital link between food security and development, on the one hand, and the problem of state fragility and conflict on the other.Of course, farmers can farm, traders can trade, but without the rule of law, without property and land rights, without peace, without trusted institutions, you cannot get your product to market.That’s why it’s time to change the way we do development. That is what Andrew Mitchell’s excellentwhite paper published todayis all about. It captures how Britain will help do this in the future. No more top-down targets that set up fragile states to fail. Instead working with them to make sure we back their priorities, help them deliver, help them to tell the story to their people about what they are doing to bring their countries to security and prosperity.We will work as partners on strategies and plans which developing countries can own and deliver.  We will push to unlock the full potential of development finance. I want us to watch as all those multilateral development banks look at their balance sheets and work out what more they can lend and we work with them to get that money into development, into the poorest countries and helping the poorest people.Finally, my fourth point – a note of optimism.We can tackle this problem. With innovation and technology, we are capable of feeding all the people on our planet. It can be done. We have the technology. We must bring it to bare.The Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote of the victims of the Holodomor in Ukraine: “not one of them was guilty of anything”. And what was true then is true now.Today, we have heard from the experts. We have heard about the tools. We have seen the commitment we need to realise Zero Hunger.And I can tell you this, the United Kingdom, the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office will be with you every step of the way as we do so.Thank you.",Conservative
Rishi Sunak,2023 Remarks at the Food Security Summit,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-remarks-at-the-food-security-summit/,"The remarks made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, at Lancaster House in London on 20 November 2023.Welcome to the Global Food Security Summit.I’d like to start by thanking our summit partners – Somalia, the UAE, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation…And I also want to thank my friend Andrew Mitchell for his incredible work on the International Development White Paper – which we’re proud to be launching today.hank you all for your participation and support today.We live in a dangerous world – a time of growing threats, strategic competition and conflict.Many of these challenges, like the war in Ukraine, have a direct impact on the poorest around in world.Others threaten to draw attention away from their plight, putting at risk the vital progress made over recent years.With this White Paper, we’re answering those challenges……changing our approach to deliver in a changing world.Because we know that you don’t lead merely with strength – but with compassion.So we’re going further to help the poorest and support those suffering in humanitarian crises.We’re not just applying our aid budget to deliver results on the ground, but also Britain’s expertise in development and our leadership in science, technology and innovation.And we’ll do all of this not by acting alone or seeking to dictate the way forward……but through building even deeper partnerships around the world, based on mutual respect.It’s only by working together that we will get the Sustainable Development Goals back on track.And that starts with redoubling our efforts to deliver the goal on “zero hunger”.It can’t be right that today in 2023, almost one billion people across the world regularly do not have enough to eat……that millions face hunger and starvation……and over 45 million children under five are suffering acute malnutrition.In a world of abundance, no one should die from lack of food.And no parent should ever have to watch their child starve.I’m proud of everything the UK is doing to provide immediate relief.We’re one of the top 4 donors to UN crisis response.We’ve doubled our aid for Palestinian civilians – with an additional £30 million.We’re clear that Israel has the right to defend itself……it has been attacked in the most brutal manner possible by an enemy that hides itself in hospitals.It must act within international humanitarian law. The situation on the ground is truly tragic and getting worse.We’re pressing hard for unhindered humanitarian access in Gaza… and for urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses to get in food, fuel and medicine……because the suffering of innocent civilians must end.We’re also leading the way in helping Ukraine get its grain out through the Black Sea and into the hands of those in need.But because the scale of the global hunger crisis is so staggering, today we’re going further……providing up to £100 million now for those worst hit, particularly across East Africa, the Sahel, and Afghanistan……and in countries like Malawi which are reeling from climate-related cyclones and drought.Yet, as everyone here knows, simply responding in the wake of crisis is not enough.Climate change, conflict and population rise mean ever greater challenges to food supplies.So we need a fundamental shift in the way we approach food security……with a focus on long-term solutions to stop food crises before they start.And we need to harness the full power of science and technology to ensure supplies are resilient to threats like conflict, drought and floods.That’s why the UK is working to deliver lasting solutions.And we’re doing so in four important ways.First, by preventing the worst forms of child malnutrition.We played a leading role in the design of the Child Nutrition Fund, which supports vital supplies of life-saving food.And today I’m pleased to announce we’re building on that with a further £16 million…… and helping to bring in more funding, including from our fantastic philanthropic partners.Second, we’re using technology to anticipate and prevent food security crises.Together with our partners, we’re applying AI to model the impact of climate change on agriculture, so that we can find ways to avoid future crises.And we know just how effective this can be.Our work with the Government of Somalia helped them avert famine last year.And today, I’m pleased to announce that will we help Somalia avoid future crises with up to £100 million of future support……enabling thousands of communities manage water supplies, adapt their farming, and increase their resilience to droughts, floods and other climate shocks.Third, we’re supporting developing countries to build more sustainable and resilient food systems.We helped set up the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program to crowd-in public and private sector finance.And now we’re driving reform of development banks, stretching their balance sheets even further to unlock more resources for food security…… and that includes UK guarantees which are releasing $6 billion of the Banks’ resources for development in countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific.Finally, we’re applying our leadership in science to this crisis.As the country that over the last few years has led the development of the world’s first and second malaria vaccines……we’re also driving scientific advances in food security which benefit millions globally……as well as supporting our brilliant farmers here at home.We’ve already helped develop crops that are drought-resistant and even richer in vitamins……now feeding 100 million people across Africa.And we’re going further… launching a new UK CGIAR Science Centre to drive cutting-edge research on flood tolerant rice, disease resistant wheat and much more.These innovations will reach millions across the poorest countries…… as well as improving UK crop yields and driving down food prices.In conclusion, this is the difference that Britain makes – using all our expertise and tools at our disposal – helping people now and for the long term.But we cannot do this alone.That’s what this summit is all about. And it’s why our approach is all about partnership.With your help, we can get the Sustainable Development Goals back on track……deliver a world of zero hunger……and transform millions of lives for years to come.Thank you – have a great summit.",Conservative
Penny Mordaunt,2023 Speech to the UK Youth Parliament,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/penny-mordaunt-2023-speech-to-the-uk-youth-parliament/,"The speech made by Penny Mordaunt, the Leader of the House of Commons, in the Commons on 17 November 2023.Thank you for being here.Many powerful men and women have sat in the seats you are sitting in today.What may surprise you is that all of them, for at least for some of their careers, would feel nervous, just as I’m sure some of you are nervous about today.You might be feeling fear and dread as to how well you are going to do today.But to be here, many of you, in fact all of you, will have had to show courage. To overcome the dread and many other obstacles to be here.The dread that says that you don’t belong here, or that you’re not good enough to be here.So as Leader of the Commons let me give you some advice for today.The dread is your friend.The dread means you are never going to be underprepared or complacent.The dread means you have already overcome your fears because you feel so strongly a call to serve others, and that means you’re going to be good at what you’re going to do today.The dread compelled you to know yourself and what is in your hearts.So if you are nervous today, that is good, be reassured and use that energy to do something wonderful here. Listen, learn and inspire others.I wish you well today and you have chosen an excellent theme and topics, and it has been my privilege to help some of you from my neck of the woods prepare for today – in one of my schools, with teachers, dinner ladies, local authority directors, testing your ideas and answering your questions.And I wanted to give you some words of advice to spur you on today and forever to live fulfilled lives in the service of one another.The words I am going to say to you now are not the words of Wilberforce or Churchill.They are from a student called Keith.People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centred.Love them anyway.If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.Do good anyway.If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.Succeed anyway.If you do good today it will be forgotten tomorrow.Do good anyway.Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.Be honest and frank anyway.The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.Think big anyway.People favour underdogs but follow only top dogs.Fight for underdogs anyway.What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.Build anyway.People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.Help people anyway.Give the world the best you have and you will get kicked in the teeth.Give the world the best you have anyway.Members, do not underestimate what you can accomplish, do not doubt the good you can do. And do not forget the importance of having fun while you are doing it.Welcome to the House of Commons.",Conservative
Robert Halfon,2023 Speech to the Committee of University Chairs,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-halfon-2023-speech-to-the-committee-of-university-chairs/,"The speech made by Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in London on 15 November 2023.Good morning and thank you for that introduction. The Committee of University Chairs promotes the highest standards of governance across the UK’s higher education sector. I am delighted to join you today to talk about lifelong learning, and how our reforms will open up your courses to new students like never before.From my travels around the country, I know that education is not and cannot be for young people only. Indeed, the definition of lifelong learning, it being the continuous, voluntary, and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge, expertise, and skills, alludes to that fact that learning is not restricted to childhood or young adulthood but occurs throughout working life. Lifelong learning is therefore an essential part the education offer in this country. As a component of the ladder of opportunity, it contributes to education’s true purpose: to provide a route for people of all backgrounds to gain valuable skills and well-paid work.  And it has never been more relevant than to today’s workforce. With an ageing population, an ever-increasing demand for skilled professionals, big data, and automation and artificial intelligence generating what is set to be, a technological revolution of unparalleled proportions, it is apparent to all that individuals will need continuous access to education and retraining throughout their lives.That is why the Lifelong Learning Entitlement will, truly, be transformative for both further and higher education. The entitlement will be equivalent to four years of higher education funding – £37,000 currently – and will galvanise people to train, retrain, and upskill across their working lives. This could be through a full-time degree, or individual modules, or other courses like higher technical qualifications or HTQs. HTQs are designed in collaboration with employers, so students can be confident that they will gain the skills needed to get on in their chosen career. HTQs lead to prestigious, sustainable jobs such as software developer, quantity surveyor and nursing associate – the jobs that employers are crying out for people to fill. So, from the 2025 to 2026 academic year, the LLE will be available for:Full courses at level 4 to level 6, such as a degree or higher technical qualifications.Modules of high-value technical courses at level 4 to level 5.This will allow people to adapt to the ever-evolving demands of the world’s sixth-largest economy. The LLE presents solutions and offers answers to this multitude of changes and opportunities.  It only takes a spark to start a fire, and the trailblazing initiative that is the LLE will revolutionise this country’s landscape of education and opportunity and alter for the better people’s perception of possibility in adulthood.Education is, without doubt, society’s greatest leveller. Firing the imagination, it opens new doors and ensures nobody is left behind. The Prime Minister has described education as the closest thing we have to a silver bullet: the best economic, social, and moral policy. Widening access to higher education this century has transformed our nation, but we need to do more. And so, we are. With the LLE, we are lighting a fire to forge an ambitious future and provide pathways for everyone, whether that be through education or employment, reskilling, or upskilling.So, the LLE will level-up access to later-life learning. It will bring FE and HE together to create a new universal student-finance system. It will enable the configuration of funding around modular, flexible provision, allowing learners to study at their own pace and in a way which suits them. It will expand maintenance support to all eligible learners and all targeted support grants are being extended to part-time courses for the first time. We will be expanding support for living costs to technical courses at levels 4-5, which remain pressing, whatever and however you study. It will remove the restrictions on students taking courses at the same or a lower level to ones they’ve already done. This will allow both new and retuning learners the freedom and the funding to upskill or retrain as best serves the next step in their careers. It will offer people regular start dates, opportunities, as they’ll be able to pick up a module at any time and move more seamlessly between institutions. And finally, it will allow learners to see their loan balance through their very own LLE personal account so they can make informed choices about the courses and learning pathways available.This is what is unique about the LLE. This change to student finance will offer diverse educational opportunities, enabling students to learn at a pace that suits them, fitting study around work, family, and personal commitments. Because whether through full-time degrees, individual modules or higher technical qualifications, we want learners to have a real choice in life. They should not feel limited to just one path or one shot at success.We have already made tremendous progress at pace on the LLE. Most recently, for example, and something of which I am particularly proud, the Lifelong Learning (HE Fee Limits) Bill became law in September. It has created a new system for applying fee limits, ensuring that the fee cap is calculated on the same basis, whether a learner is studying individual modules separately, or studying them together on a typical full-time course.During the passage of the act, I committed to provide further information on fee limits so providers could prepare for the LLE’s introduction. I am pleased to announce that this information is today being published on gov.uk. In this, we are setting out the list of chargeable numbers of credits for every course type, as well as the number of credits that can be charged for in any single course year.Of course, not all programmes are credit-bearing courses. Courses such as medicine, veterinary science and dentistry are exceptions, and their fee limits will be set using a default number of credits.The publication also includes the list of course types to which this default system applies, to give providers and learners all the information they need to prepare for 2025.It also gives me great pleasure to say that we are also setting out further detail today on learner entitlement. The LLE will be available to both new and returning learners.  Whilst new learners will be able to access the full entitlement (equivalent to 4 years full-time tuition), those returning to higher-level education will be able to access their residual tuition loan entitlement. They can use this to access any LLE course, whether a full degree, short course, or a module. This opens up the entitlement to people of many different educational backgrounds, allowing them to refresh their skills or seek brand-new qualifications.Details of how we will calculate residual entitlement are also being published today. We will consider both the cash value of loans taken out by learners, and the modern equivalent cost for those who studied under previous funding regimes. In doing so, we have prioritised value for taxpayers, and ensure that learners who want to use the LLE to retrain or upskill can do so on an equitable basis.The Lifelong Learning Entitlement represents a significant leap forward in providing accessible, adaptable, and inclusive education. It embodies this government’s commitment to empower individuals to furnace their own education pathways, adapt to change, and contribute to a stronger and healthier economy. Truly, I am so excited to be consistently making great strides on the LLE and its plethora of constituent parts. And I am so enthusiastic that this once-in-a-generation reform of our higher-education sector will enable people to move seamlessly between further education and higher education, taking the opportunities that best serve their career stage and fit around their commitments.However, this can’t happen without your support. I hope that the higher-education sector will embrace the burning ambition of the LLE. It has the power to light the proverbial fire, to benefit learners, employers, and universities alike.For learners, the LLE will kindle a desire for personal and professional development, allowing them the opportunity to learn, reskill or upskill. For universities and colleges, the LLE will spark discourse about efficient and effective education delivery, inspiring them to think differently, more radically, and to trigger spirited and significant collaboration and co-operation between higher and further education. For employers, the LLE will ignite the talent foundry and cast a stronger and larger labour force. This will allow them to bridge skills gaps in their workforce, encouraging staff to upskill via modular learning and progress professionally in a way that is responsive to their needs.I hope I have painted an exciting picture of the developments to come. Together with other DfE initiatives like skills bootcamps, apprenticeships, and our adult learning offer apprenticeships, the LLE forms part of our blazing desire to enhance human capability and productivity, so that every person in this country can pursue the education that they need and deliver on their full potential. I hope you see the possibilities that this landmark reform will present to the sector, and I look forward to working with you to make those possibilities a reality for universities, colleges, and students.As we move forward, therefore, let us embrace this revolutionary reform and transformative journey together. Education should inflame curiosity and creativity. It should fuel a passion for learning and a lifelong pursuit of knowledge. Just as a fire spreads and grows, so should education spark a desire to explore and discover new things. With the LLE, we hope that lifelong learning will become the norm. Even more so, we hope students catch a spark and light a fire. We want our education system to be about those fires. So very many of them.Thank you.",Conservative
Victoria Atkins,2023 Speech at the NHS Providers Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/victoria-atkins-2023-speech-at-the-nhs-providers-conference/,"The speech made by Victoria Atkins, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, on 15 November 2023.Hello, everyone.I want to start by thanking you all for all the fantastic and vital work you do.I’m sorry I can’t be with you in Liverpool. But I’m really looking forward to getting to know you and working with you in the weeks and months ahead.It’s a genuine pleasure and a privilege to be your Health and Social Care Secretary.My belief in our National Health Service, and its founding principles, is one of the reasons I came into politics.Now, I know you might hear this a lot. But for me, it is truly personal.Like families up and down the country, I owe our NHS a lot. It has cared for me and my family, and brought my wonderful son into the world.And I want to make sure that it’s here in fighting fit form for our children and our grandchildren, just as it’s been here for us.We have got a lot of work to do. As we continue to bed-in the reforms government brought forward last year to create strong and integrated care systems across England.This will be a shared endeavour.And it will require all of us to work in partnership. Across our acute hospitals, mental health, community, general practice, and pharmacy.As we reduce the pressures that I know you’re facing, we give patients the best possible care, and deliver the Urgent and Emergency Care Recovery Plan for winter.We know winter will be challenging. But this year, we have all started to prepare earlier than ever before.And using our recovery plan, we can continue to expand capacity, build resilience, and deliver better care. This has to be our number one priority.And I recognise that this requires working collaboratively with other organisations and sectors. For example, working with the police to support people suffering from mental health crises.And I’m also very conscious that I’m not just the Secretary of State for the NHS – I’m also the Secretary of State for Social Care.Our unpaid carers and social care workers look after millions of people every single day. And I cannot wait to work with them too.Now, we’ll face challenges along the way. But believe me, I am an optimist. Together, we can overcome these challenges, and take the long-term decisions that will build a brighter future for our NHS.And this is the approach I will take to industrial action.I’m acutely aware of how the strikes have disrupted patient care, and I’m committed to getting around the table.Because, I want to see a fair and reasonable resolution.This winter will be challenging, but I know that rising to such challenges is what you all do so well.You’ve overcome a once in a generation pandemic. You’ve tackled the longest waits for care it left behind. And you’re delivering reforms that will give patients more choice and control over their care.We’ve got clear recovery plans in place. Financial certainty for the rest of the year. And the first-ever, fully funded, reform-focused, long-term workforce plan. Something that I know NHS Providers have been a strong champion for.Now, I started this speech by thanking you. I mean it sincerely to you and all of the incredible people who work in our NHS and social care services.So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get on with the job. Now is the time to deliver for patients, and deliver for our NHS.",Conservative
Robert Halfon,2023 Speech at the Association of Colleges’ Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/robert-halfon-2023-speech-at-the-association-of-colleges-annual-conference/,"The speech made by Robert Halfon, the Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education, in Birmingham on 14 November 2023.Good morning, and thank you for that introduction.The Association of Colleges is an important voice for further education, and a key contributor to the work of the department. After a year in-post as Skills Minister, I’m delighted to be speaking today on how we are continuing to move skills to the centre of education.I first visited Harlow College shortly after being elected as an MP. Thanks to the vision of two exceptional leaders – including Karen Spencer, the current Principal – it has been transformed into one of the country’s leading colleges. I’ve now visited more than 100 times, as well as many other FE colleges, from Loughborough to Oldham, Waltham Forest to Stroud, and Telford to Gateshead. Seeing their facilities and focus on training students for success, helped me understand how FE colleges bring about social justice.FE colleges are places of social and economic capital, and I am proud to be their champion in government. From beginning on the backbenches, to chairing the Education Select Committee and my time as Skills Minister – everything I’ve done in Parliament has been to promote skills education and boost support for FE.I don’t hold a meeting, or comment on a ministerial submission without asking: “What about FE? What are we doing to help it thrive?”As my officials will tell you, further education does not get forgotten on my watch.I believe FE colleges are a key pillar of the Ladder of Opportunity, enabling people of all backgrounds to gain sought-after skills and good jobs.I’m really proud of what we’ve achieved over the last year. We saw more than 335,000 apprenticeship starts, with full figures for the academic year to be published shortly.To help colleges and providers accommodate these new apprentices, in March we distributed £286 million via the Capital Transformation Fund to enhance your facilities. In July we announced £185 million for the 2023-24 financial year, to drive forward skills delivery in further education. This will be followed by £285 million in 2024-25. It will allow colleges and other 16-19 providers to improve recruitment and retention of teachers in high-value technical and academic subjects. In fact I was delighted to receive feedback last month from a college Principal, who was able to give their staff a significant pay award following this announcement. Our investment recognises the importance of your work to the country’s future economic growth and prosperity.In order to look to what the future holds, I’d like to glance back to the past. Some of you may know that I’m a great admirer of many 20th Century American presidents. The obvious parallel with my life is that of Franklin D. Roosevelt – who despite being paralysed by polio, taught himself to walk short distances with leg braces and a cane.The great wartime president famously pitched his 4 universal freedoms in 1941 to persuade America to abandon non-interventionism and join the war effort.As I’m sure you know, those freedoms were: Freedom of speech, Freedom of worship, Freedom from want, and Freedom from fear.While I’m glad to say that further education does not face a comparable existential threat, Roosevelt’s freedoms got me thinking about what FE needs to thrive, and where its future lies. I think there are 4 challenges it will need to meet over the next few years. I will outline them here, along with the support government is providing to help the sector face these changes.The first challenge is fully resourcing the further education we know we need.Properly resourcing further education includes allowing colleges to focus on what you do best –teaching vital skills, rather than negotiating bureaucracy and red tape. I will make sure we deliver existing commitments to make things easier, such as bringing together multiple revenue and capital grants in a Single Development Fund. We have already simplified funding rates at Level 3 and below, and reduced the apprenticeship onboarding process by a third. Our Expert Provider pilot is exploring how to further simplify the delivery of apprenticeships, so that you can focus on growth and quality. I have asked officials to think radically about streamlining end-to-end funding processes, and would welcome your input on this.Deploying funding where it will hold most value for learners and businesses is really important. Last week we announced the Local Skills Improvement Fund allocations – more than £200 million for colleges and universities to offer training to address specific regional skills needs. Through Local Skills Improvement Plans, priority sectors are now able to steer funding towards the local skills provision needed to grow their workforce and the regional economy.Bringing about a skills revolution, where more people choose high-quality technical education, necessarily means more FE teachers. On top of the additional £470 million I previously outlined to help with recruitment and retention, we are also investing in a package of direct support for those entering the workforce. This includes the new measures linked to the Advanced British Standard. We are expanding the Levelling Up Premium to give eligible teachers up to £6,000 annually, after tax, in addition to their pay. That’s those in the first five years of their career, teaching key STEM and technical subjects in disadvantaged schools, and – for the first time – in colleges too.It is really significant that the Prime Minister mentioned these incentives in his speech to party conference, an arena where further education hasn’t frequently been acknowledged. When I say we are bringing FE to the centre of our policy plans, I mean it. I hate it when people call further education the Cinderella sector – but as in the story, Cinderella is now well on her way to joining the royal family. FE is central to the world class education system we wish to build.This brings me to the Advanced British Standard, and our second challenge: rolling-out T Levels while we develop this new, overarching qualification.When the ABS was announced, there was some concern that it had come to bury T Levels. What was the point of 3 years’ roll out, if T Levels were eventually going to be surpassed by something else? I’m here to tell you that one supports the other: T Levels will provide the backbone of the Advanced British Standard. We will continue to roll them out, with more to come in 2024-25.Technical education has undergone unprecedented reform over the last decade, and we will continue this programme to simplify the skills landscape and create a stronger set of qualifications than ever before. All of this puts T Levels in a better position than any current qualification. As I say, they will be the backbone of the occupational route of the Advanced British Standard – making them the most “future proof” option you can offer 16-19-year-olds.It’s thanks to all those pioneers here today, who championed T Levels from the start, that we can see a way to achieving a long held ambition: parity of esteem for technical and academic education. But we need your continued support. The best advocates for T Levels, who can demonstrate their benefits and versatility to upcoming year groups, are yourselves – Principals, tutors and teachers.I’ve really enjoyed meeting college staff who have welcomed the Advanced British Standard, and the breadth of education it will, for the first time, afford every young person. Thousands of T Level students have gone on to take apprenticeships, jobs with top employers and places at university. Now is the time to persuade the Year 11s visiting your open days to consider T Levels, and the life-changing opportunities they bring.The third challenge is to re-enforce further education as the Ladder of Opportunity for those who need it most.FE’s power lies in the difference it can make to the lives of people who need a leg-up.That’s why I’m so enthusiastic about it, and keen that this life-changing difference can reach as many as possible.The Lifelong Learning Entitlement will do just that, democratising access to student finance like never before. It is the most exciting opportunity for learners in a generation, opening up skills training to people who previously thought it wasn’t affordable or applicable to them.The LLE will transform FE when it launches in 2025. It will provide a loan entitlement equivalent to four years’ post-18 education (£37,000 in today’s fees) for use throughout people’s working lives.As well as conventional higher technical or degree level studies, it will be redeemable against  high-value modular courses, provided by FE colleges and universities.I think it’s hard overstate just how much flexible student finance will alter attitudes to retraining and upskilling. Like getting on and off a train, learners will be able to alight and board their post-school education when it suits them, rather than being confined to a single ticket. They can choose to build their qualifications over time, using both further and higher education providers. They will have real choice in how and when they study, enabling them to acquire life-changing skills to improve their employment options.The prospect of attaining good, skilled work will be in closer reach of everybody.And that opportunity is so important. My hero President Roosevelt knew this.When he spoke directly to the American people in 1937, he said:The inherent right to work is one of the elemental privileges of a free people. Continued failure to achieve that right and privilege by anyone who wants to work, and needs work, is a challenge to our civilization and to our security.Endowed, as our nation is, with abundant physical resources, and inspired as it should be with the high purpose to make those resources and opportunities available for the enjoyment of all, we approach this problem of reemployment with the real hope of finding a better answer than we have now.The LLE is that real hope of a better answer – that education can live up to its ideals by being available in the right way, at the right time, to those who need it most.The LLE has the power to light the proverbial touchpaper – to benefit learners, employers, and colleges alike. I hope it triggers significant new collaborations between businesses, colleges and universities. Your ongoing engagement is crucial to delivering this transformation of student finance, and ensuring it benefits as many people as possible.Further education students need just as much support to complete their studies and make a success of their efforts as undergraduates. In fact, they often need more – especially those from a disadvantaged backgrounds. The social justice of helping these students to succeed is a key pillar of the Ladder of Opportunity, and an absolute priority for me.That is why I am delighted to announce the appointment of Polly Harrow as the first Further Education Student Support Champion. She will act as a channel between the sector and government, driving a strategic approach to improving the experience of students at colleges. I look forward to working with her, alongside Shelagh Legrave the FE Commissioner, to bring your concerns to the heart of government.The 4th challenge we face is the future! The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Artificial Intelligence and the rising demand for green skills.AI is the acronym of the moment, but it will have a huge impact on our future – including the labour market. Lots of repetitive administrative tasks will be streamlined, but programmers and task managers will be still needed to build and manage the digital infrastructure. As with other automated systems, complementary human skills will ensure AI is used to greatest effect and to maintain quality outputs. FE will be a crucial part of this new dynamic, with its ability to adapt provision to meet the skills needs of local employers. We’re already seeing great examples of provision innovation, such as Basingstoke College of Technology’s new skills modules on using AI safely and productively.And some tasks will always require a human touch. The government’s transformative expansion of childcare is just one of the currents that run counter to the idea that human work is drying-up. Growing the Early Years workforce to deliver these reforms is a government priority, and presents a huge opportunity for colleges and learners. Now is the time to enter this expanding industry, with great training and progression routes.Green skills are another important aspect of the future labour market. They should be part of your skills offer – not just to arrest global warming, but to catch the global winds of economic change. The economy and the jobs market are shifting permanently in this direction, and your learners should have the training opportunities to capitalise on that. Harlow College, which I mentioned earlier, has two green training facilities – an advanced manufacturing centre for electric vehicles, and a renewable energy centre. They are already bringing sort-after skilled employment to people in my constituency.Our Skills Bootcamps have already seen 1000s of adults get a head start in sectors that need them, including green industries. Bootcamps currently offer flexible training in green construction, renewable energy, natural resources protection and green transport. I would encourage all colleges here today to apply for Skills Bootcamps funding and embrace this unique entry point for adult learners. Officials from the department are running a Bootcamps breakout session tomorrow, which I’d urge delegates to join!I want to finish by turning back to President Roosevelt, and his stirring address to Congress in 1941. Elsewhere in the speech he describes ‘equality of opportunity for youth and for others’ as an important part of a strong democracy.Many of you here today do so much to advance this measure of progress – working tirelessly to extend equality of opportunity to all your students. That to me is the true purpose of education:  to bring about social justice, so that everyone has the chance to improve their prospects, and contribute to society and the economy.I know we have much more to do, within a changing economic landscape – but I look forward working with you to accomplish it.Thank you, and I hope you enjoy today’s conference.",Conservative
Lucy Frazer,2023 Speech to the WeCreate Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/lucy-frazer-2023-speech-to-the-wecreate-conference/,"The speech made by Lucy Frazer, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on 14 November 2023.Good afternoon everyone.I wanted to start with a huge thank you to all of you for making the time to be here today.Today isn’t just about celebrating all the things that make our Creative Industries special, but it is also about looking ahead to the future to see how we, together, can chart a course that keeps these crown jewels of our economy shining for years to come.And there’s no better place to look to that future than right here in Manchester.As somebody who grew up not too far away in Leeds, I remember Emmerdale, visits to the IMAX in Bradford, and the arrival of the Armouries.I soon learned at school that across the M62 Manchester was one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution – a city dubbed ‘Cottonopolis’ in honour of its place at the epicentre of our thriving cotton industry in the 19th century.But Manchester – as you all will know – is also a thriving place for our culture.Oasis, Danny Boyle, Lowry.Creativity is part of the fabric of this city today.Just look at this venue we’re gathered here today in.The largest cultural investment in this country since the Tate Modern two decades ago.Built on a site already rich in creative historyThis is the former site of Granada Studios – which had hosted the Beatles’ first TV appearance and was home to Coronation Street.And now we have this incredible multi-purpose cultural hub that will welcome millions of guests a year, support thousands of jobs across the local creative economy and host hundreds of gigs, exhibitions and events every year.I was absolutely delighted to be here when it opened officially a month ago.It was clear then – and it’s still clear now – that this venue will be one of the focal points of a vibrant cultural scene in Manchester and the country for decades to come.When I was made Culture Secretary at the start of this year, I made growing those creative industries one of my main priorities.In the past decade or so, these industries have become one of our most powerful economic engines of growth.And if we can help more people across the country to discover and nurture their creative potential, then we will see our economy and wider society grow and grow and grow.Earlier this year we set out a long term plan for the future of the creative industries.The Sector Vision was developed across government and I’m delighted to be joined here today with Minister John Whittingdale and Viscount Camrose from DSIT, as well as  colleagues from the Departments for Education, and Business and Trade.The sector vision was developed jointly, as well as through government, with industry too through the work of the Creative Industries Council, who I met with this morning.And I want to work with each and every one of you to deliver on our Creative Industries Sector Vision.It’s a blueprint with three very simple aims:to grow our Creative Industries by an extra £50 billion by 2030to create a million extra jobs – all over the country – by 2030and to deliver a Creative Careers Promise that harnesses the potential of young people and constructs a pipeline of talent into our creative industries.We’re already making progress towards those ambitious goals set out in our sector vision, unveiling millions in new funding to drive growth in our grassroots and scale ups and banging the drum for our creative careers.We are doubling the number of areas in the Create Growth Programme, with almost £11 million additional funding which means we are able to provide targeted support to around 1,800 creative businesses so that they can access private investment and scale up.Thanks to this new funding, businesses in the East and West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, the South West and the East of England will benefit from tailored workshops, mentoring and training to maximise creative potential.Greater Manchester has been delivering this programme and an earlier pilot, and it’s because of the success we’ve seen here in transforming local creative businesses that we are expanding it to other areas today.From today, we’re also launching applications to the £5 million Supporting Grassroots Music Fund to ensure support for the lifeblood of our world-leading music sector and cornerstones of our community.I am also pleased that today marks the beginning of Creative Careers Week – an initiative supported by my department to inspire the next generation to go into the creative industries so we can build that pipeline of talent and I welcome the many events happening across the country to encourage more young people to consider a job in these inspiring sectors.But most importantly today I am here to talk and to listen to you.Because we can only achieve our ambitions – this growth can only happen, these jobs can only be created, this pipeline of talent will only be sustained – if you are supported to maximise your potential.And that is what today is about.Some of you have been working with us already, whether that’s through our UK Global Screen Fund, The Create Growth Programme, the UK Games Fund or the UKRI Creative Clusters programme or our work with the Arts Council.It’s great to be joined by organisations such as Production Park, HOME, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, but it’s also exciting to meet new organisations as wellToday I want to be a call to arms to all of you to share your ideas with us in Government and to work with us to unlock the creative potential of our people and our businesses – particularly here in the North.This region is already a driver of growth across the UK economy with major employers, export intensive businesses that attract significant investment from overseas.We will never deliver on the goals we set out in the Creative Industries Vision without your businesses, your ideas, your imagination.Government, industry and academic leaders across the North are already forming a grand coalition to develop a new regional strategy – The Northern Creative Corridor.There’ll be new details about this exciting initiative announced tomorrow.And I also recognise that it’s a difficult time at the moment.The cost-of-living has been a bit of a perfect storm for the sectors you all represent and you’re all wrestling with different challenges: whether that’s the tight labour market, access to finance or the possible future impact of AI.But none of this should dampen our ambition.You know better than anyone else that the North of England emanates so much creativity and that, with the right conditions, creative businesses can flourish.So, I’d just like to end by one final thank you to all of you for being here today and for investing your time and energy in the future of our creative industries.I hope you find the sessions useful and that we can keep this partnership going long into the future.I mentioned earlier this venue is the biggest cultural investment from the Government since the Tate Modern.Today that venue is a global cultural icon, famous around the world.I and my Ministerial team can’t wait to work with you to make this venue and our Creative Industries in the North as big a success in the years to come.",Conservative
Michelle Donelan,2023 Speech to the FOSI Annual Conference,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/michelle-donelan-2023-speech-to-the-fosi-annual-conference/,"The speech made by Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, on 14 November 2023.Hello and thank you for having me here today, it is a pleasure to be in Washington.Now from the outset I must confess I have brought a numerous amount of British bugs with me, and so if I end up coughing, spluttering, drying up, please forgive me and bear with me, but I will do my very best throughout the speech.And there is a reason that my first speech on the subject of online safety, since the UK’s world leading Online Safety Act passed is taking place here in the United States. Because the UK and the USA obviously share a special relationship that is fundamentally about our values.The Online Safety Act – which I want to talk about for a bit today – is about reaffirming our longstanding values and principles and extending them to the online world. Empowering adults, protecting free expression, standing up for the rule of law, and most importantly, protecting our children.These are the values that Britain has pioneered for centuries, and they are also the values that made the extraordinary story of the United States possible.In the most recent chapter of that story, the transformational power of the internet has created the online world that is increasingly, seamlessly intertwined with the real world. But the values that made our free, safe, liberal societies possible have not been reflected online – especially when it comes to social media.The guardrails, customs and rules that we have taken for granted offline have, in the last two decades, become noticeable in their absence online. FOSI have been an important part of the conversation to identify this problem, and I want to extend my thanks to you for all the tireless work that you’ve done on this incredibly important agenda.And thanks to the work of campaigners here and in the UK, lawmakers from Washington to Westminster have taken the issue of online safety increasingly seriously, especially when it comes to the protection of our children.And today I want to share with you how we rose to the challenge of online safety in the UK – what we did, how we did it, and I guess why we did it as well.I think the why of that equation is the best place to start, given FOSI’s role in helping to answer that question over the years. Now, my department was created back in February to seize the opportunities of our digital age. Not just the opportunities that are in front of our generation now, but the opportunities that will potentially shape the futures of our children and our grandchildren.My 6-month-old son will grow up thinking nothing of his ability to communicate with people thousands of miles away and, I hope, he’s going to go on and do much more. Sharing research with his school friends potentially, learning new languages about countries that he might not have even visited, and gaining new skills that will enable him to fully take advantage of his talents when he grows up. Of course, if you ask my husband, he will tell you he hopes that those talents will lead him to the Premier League football.But we cannot afford to ignore the dangers that our children increasingly face online and I do think it is a sobering fact that children nowadays are just a few clicks away from entering adulthood, whether that’s opening a laptop or picking up an iPad.And despite the voluntary efforts of companies and the incredible work of campaigners, the stats tell us unequivocally that voluntary efforts are simply not enough.Did you know that the average age that a child sees pornography is 13? When I first heard that, it really, really struck me as something that needs to be dealt with. And a staggering 81% of 12–15-year-olds have reported coming across inappropriate content when surfing the web, including sites promoting suicide and self-harm.Now, regardless of ideology or political party, I don’t think anyone can look at what’s happening to our children and suggest that a hands-off approach that has dominated so far is working.I believe that we have a responsibility and in fact a duty to act when the most vulnerable in our society are under an increasing threat – especially our children.So, when I stood in the House of Commons during the Bill’s passage, I said enough is enough – and I meant it.Now, I defy any person who says it cannot or should not be done – as adults it is our fundamental duty to protect children and be that shield for them against those who wish to do them harm. And that is why in the UK, I have been on somewhat of a mission to shield our children through the Online Safety Act.And we started with the obvious – applying the basic common-sense principles of what is illegal offline, should actually be illegal online. Quite simply if it is illegal in the streets – it should be illegal in the tweets.No longer will tech companies be able to run Wild West platforms where they can turn a blind eye to things like terrorism and child abuse. The days of platforms filled with underage users, when even adverts are tailored to those underage users, are now over.If you host content only suitable for adults, then you must use highly effective age assurance tools to prevent children from getting access.We can and we will prevent children from seeing content that they can never unsee – pornography, self harm, serious violence, eating disorder material – no child in Britain will have to grow up being exposed to that in the future and I think that that is quite remarkable. Because when we consider the impact that that content is having on our children, it is quite frankly horrific.Of course, we know that most websites and all the major social media platforms already have some policies in place to safeguard children – in a few days I am travelling to Silicon Valley to meet many of them, and what I will be telling them, is that the Online Safety Act is less about companies doing what the Government is asking them to do – it is about the companies doing what their users are asking them to do.Most companies actually do have robust and detailed terms of service. In fact, all of the 10 largest social media platforms in the world ban sexism, they ban racism, homophobia, and just about every other form of illegal abuse imaginable.Yet these terms are worthless unless they are enforced – and too often, they are not consistently enforced.So, the legislation that we have produced in the UK will mean that social media platforms will be required to uphold their own terms and conditions.For the first time ever, users in Britain can sign up to platforms knowing that the terms they agree with will actually be upheld, and that the platforms will face eye-watering fines if they fail to do so.But do not make the mistake of thinking that this Act is anti-business. Far from it, we view the Online Safety Act as a chance to harness the good that social media can do whilst tackling the bad, and because we believe in proportionality and innovation, we have not been prescriptive in how social media giants and messaging platforms should go about complying.I believe it’s never the role of the Government to dictate to business which technologies they use. Our approach has remained ‘tech neutral’ and business friendly.To borrow an American phrase, we are simply ensuring that they step up to the plate and to use their own vast resources and expertise to provide the best possible protections for children.And I know this matters on the other side of the Atlantic too, because the online world does not respect borders, and those who wish to do our children harm should not be undeterred by this sense that they can get away with it in some countries and not in others, or that they should be able to use this to their advantage.And that is why in the UK, we are taking steps to enable our online safety regulator, Ofcom, to share information with regulators overseas including here.These powers will complement existing initiatives, such as the Global Online Safety Regulators Network. A vital programme – which of course was launched at the FOSI conference last year – bringing together like-minded regulators to promote and protect human rights.And this momentum has been backed up by government action too. I am talking about the US Administration establishing an inter-agency Kids Online Health and Safety Task Force, and both of these are very welcome signs of the increasing unity between the UK and the US on this important agenda.Many of the aims perfectly complement what we are trying to do in the UK and I am keen that both our governments continue to work together.And while protecting children has remained our priority throughout the legislative process, we have been incredibly innovative with the way that we help protect adults online too. I believe when it comes to adults, we must take a different approach to the one that we take for children.Liberty and free expression are the cornerstones of the UK’s uncodified constitution, and of course at the heart of the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. So when thinking about protecting adults online, we knew we could not compromise these fundamental principles.In fact, I believe that the Act would have to actively promote and protect freedom and liberty for adults if it were to be successful in the long term, and that’s exactly what we did.So rather than tell adults what legal content they can and cannot see, we instead decided to empower adults with freedom and choice – on many platforms for the very first time. Known as user empowerment tools, the Bill requires companies to finally give adults a direct choice over the types of content they see and engage with.Taking the power out of the hands of unaccountable algorithms and placing it back in the hands of each and every individual user. Where an adult does not want to see certain types of legal content, they will have the power to toggle that content on and off as they choose, and in some cases, filter out keywords.Choice, freedom, and control for adults, while robustly protecting children at the same time. Combined together, these form the framework that we believe will become the global norm for online safety in the decades ahead.Now, just finally, while the glow of our successful Global AI Safety Summit is still bright, I want to touch briefly on the challenges of AI when it comes to online safety.We are discussing ‘New Frontiers in Online Safety’ today – and it is impossible to do that without talking about the technology that will define this century.Although AI brings enormous opportunities – from combating climate change to discovering life-saving drugs, to obviously helping our public services, it does also bring grave risk too – including on online safety, and we saw that just the other month in southern Spain, where fake, nude images of real girls had been created using AI – a case that shocked us all.And recently in Britain, fake AI-generated audio also targeted the leader of the opposition and spread rapidly on social media before being promptly debunked. So, we must be clear about the serious threat AI presents to our societies, from our children’s safety to our democratic processes and the integrity of our elections, something that we both care acutely about as we march towards our elections.And that is why we hosted the first ever AI Safety Summit earlier this month at Bletchley Park, where 28 countries and the European Union were represented, representing the vast majority of the world’s population. And we signed an unprecedented agreement known as the Bletchley Declaration.Despite some claiming that such a declaration would be rejected by many countries in attendance, we actually agreed that for the good of all, AI should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and of course responsible.But I have been clear that when it comes to online safety, especially for our children, we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball in the decade to come.And the historic Bletchley Declaration lays out a pathway for countries to follow together that will ultimately lead to a safer online world, but it is up to us all to ensure that we continue down that pathway.And In support of that mission, I have directed the UK’s Frontier AI Taskforce to rapidly evolve into a new AI Safety Institute, giving our best and brightest minds a key role to really delve into the risks that AI presents as well as the pre-deployment testing. And of course, it will partner with the US’s own Safety Institute which the Vice President announced in London during the summit.We must also recognise AI can of course be part of the solution to many of the problems we are discussing today, as well – from detecting and moderating harmful content to proactively mitigating potential risks like the generation and dissemination of deep fakes.FOSI’s new report, published today – does provide important insights on the early use of generative AI tools by parents and teens, and how it will impact children’s safety and privacy online.I will be taking these findings back to my officials in London and ensuring that we deepen the already close relationship between our two countries when it comes to protecting our children.Now, while I hope my speech today has been somewhat of a soft-sell if you like for the online safety framework that we have created in the UK, I actually don’t think our approach really requires salesmanship to the rest of the world. Because even before our Online Safety Act became law, companies began implementing key parts of its provisions and adapting their behaviour.Many social media platforms now allow keyword filtering, some have started exploring and piloting age assurance methods, and many are proactively cleaning up illegal content through new innovative techniques.So, if there is one thing I want to say to American policymakers who want to make a real difference for children and adults online, it’s be ambitious, put children first, front and centre, and above all, defend the values that you would expect to see on the streets as ferociously online as you would in person.As the online world and the offline world merge ever closer together, now is the time to stand firm and uphold the values that we share, and the values that got us here in the first place.Thank you.",Conservative
Jeremy Hunt,2023 Autumn Statement,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/jeremy-hunt-2023-autumn-statement/,"The speech made by Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons on 22 November 2023.Mr Speaker. After a global pandemic and energy crisis, we have taken difficult decisions to put our economy back on track. We have supported families with rising bills, cut borrowing and halved inflation.Rather than a recession, the economy has grown. Rather than falling as predicted, real incomes have risen. Our plan for the British economy is working. But the work is not done. Under this Prime Minister we take decisions for the long term.In today’s Autumn Statement for Growth our choice is not big government, high spending and high tax because we know that leads to less growth, not more. Instead we reduce debt, cut taxes and reward work. We deliver world class education. We build domestic sustainable energy.And we back British business with 110 growth measures – don’t worry, I’m not going to go through them all – but in summary they……remove planning red tape…speed up access to the national grid…support entrepreneurs raising capital…get behind our fastest growing industries…unlock foreign direct investment…boost productivity…reform welfare…level up opportunity to every corner of the country…and cut business taxes.The Office for Budget Responsibility say that the combined impact of these measures will raise business investment, get more people into work, reduce inflation next year and increase GDP. A dynamic economy depends on the energy and enterprise of people more than any diktats or decisions by ministers.So, today’s measures do not just remove barriers to investment, they reward effort and work.  I will go through the measures in three parts.In the first, I will use updated OBR forecasts to show the progress we are making against the Prime Minister’s economic priorities.The second part sets out growth measures to back British business.Finally, I conclude with measures to make work pay.Progress on the Prime Minster’s prioritiesBefore I start with the forecasts, I want to express my horror at the murderous attack on Israeli citizens on October 7th and the subsequent loss of life on both sides. I will remember for the rest of my life – as I know many other hon members will – being taken to Auschwitz by the Rabbi Barry Marcus and the remarkable Holocaust Educational Trust. But I am deeply concerned about the rise of antisemitism in our country. So, I am announcing up to £7m over the next three years for organisations like the Holocaust Educational Trust to tackle antisemitism in schools and universities. I will also repeat the £3m uplift to the Community Security Trust.When it comes to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism, we must never allow the clock to be turned back.I now move on to the OBR’s economic and fiscal forecasts, and I thank Richard Hughes and his team for their sterling work in preparing them. Three of my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister’s five pledges at the start of the year were economic: to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt. Today I can report to the House that we are delivering on all three.InflationLet’s start with inflation. When the Prime Minister and I took office, inflation was at 11.1%. Last week, it fell to 4.6%. We promised to halve inflation and we have halved it. Core inflation is now lower than in nearly half of the economies in the EU.  And the OBR say headline inflation will fall to 2.8% by the end of 2024, before falling to the 2% target in 2025.I will not take risks with inflation, and the OBR confirm that the measures I take today make inflation lower next year than it would otherwise have been. I thank the Independent Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee for their crucial role in bringing down inflation.  We will continue to back them to do whatever it takes until the job is done. But as we do, we will continue to support families in difficulty.Today I add four further measures to help with the cost of living. Firstly, for those on the lowest incomes. I understand the concerns some have about the effect on work incentives of matching benefit increases to inflation.I know there has been some speculation that we would increase benefits next year by the lower October figure for inflation. But cost of living pressures remain at their most acute for the poorest families. So instead, the government has decided to increase Universal Credit and other benefits from next April by 6.7% in line with September’s inflation figure, an average increase of £470 for 5.5m households next year.  Vital support to those on the very lowest incomes.Second, because rent can constitute more than half the living costs of private renters on the lowest incomes, I have listened closely to many colleagues as well as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Resolution Foundation, Citizens Advice UK and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation who said unfreezing the Local Housing Allowance was an ‘urgent priority’.I will therefore increase the Local Housing Allowance rate to the 30th percentile of local market rents. This will give 1.6 million households an average of £800 of support next year.Third, although I am going to increase duty on hand-rolling tobacco by an additional 10% above the tobacco duty escalator, I know that for many people going to the pub has become more expensive. I have listened closely to the persuasive arguments on alcohol duties from my Honourable Friend for Moray and my Rt Hon Friend for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, fierce champions of the Scotch whisky industry. I’ve also listened to defenders of the great British pint such as my Rt Honourable Friends for the Vale of Glamorgan and Buckingham; in my constituency to Councillor Jane Austin who is a big supporter of the Jolly Farmer pub in Bramley; and indeed to The Sun newspaper. So, as well as confirming our Brexit Pubs Guarantee, which means duty on a pint is always lower than in the shops, I have decided to freeze all alcohol duty until August 1st next year. That means no increase in duty on beer, cider, wine or spirits.Finally, pensioners. The triple lock has helped lift 250,000 older people out of poverty since it was instituted in 2011 and been a lifeline for many during a period of high inflation.  There have been reports that we would uprate it by a lower amount to smooth out the effect of high public sector bonuses in July, but that would have been particularly difficult for one million pensioners whose only income is from the state.So instead, today we honour our commitment to the triple lock in full. From April 2024, we will increase the full new state pension by 8.5% to £221.20 a week, worth up to £900 more a year. That is one of the largest ever cash increases to the state pension – showing this government will always back our pensioners.Including today’s measures, our total commitment to easing cost of living pressures has risen to £104 billion. That includes paying around half the cost of the average energy bill since last October and amounts to an average of £3700 per household.We are able to do that only because we reduced the deficit by 80% ahead of the pandemic.Borrowing and debtNext, I turn to my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister’s pledge to reduce debt.  Before I took difficult decisions at last year’s Autumn Statement, debt was predicted to rise to almost 100% of GDP by the end of the forecast. Since then, the economy has outperformed expectations and I have taken difficult decisions to reduce borrowing. As a result, headline debt is now predicted to be 94% of GDP by the end of the forecast. The OBR today forecast underlying debt will be 91.6% of GDP next year, 92.7% in 2024-25, 93.2% in 2026-27, before declining in the final two years of the forecast to 92.8% in 2028-29. That is lower in every year compared to forecasts in the Spring. We therefore meet our fiscal rule to have underlying debt falling as a percentage of GDP in the final year of the forecast, with double the headroom compared to the OBR’s March forecast.And we continue to have the second lowest government debt in the G7 – lower than the United States, Canada, France, Italy or Japan.I turn to borrowing. According to the OBR, borrowing is lower this year and next, and on average across the forecast by £0.7 billion every year compared to the Spring Budget forecasts.  It falls from 4.5% of GDP in 2023-24, to 3.0%, 2.7%, 2.3%, 1.6% and 1.1% in 2028-29. That means we also meet our second fiscal rule – that public sector borrowing must be below 3% of GDP – not just by the final year, but in almost every year of the forecast. Some of this improvement is from higher tax receipts from a stronger economy, but we also maintain a disciplined approach to public spending.As I set out in the Spring Budget, resource spending will increase by 1% a year from 2025-26 in real terms and we are sustaining the record 2020 increase in capital spending in cash terms until the end of the forecast. Within this, we will meet our NATO commitment to spend 2% of our GDP on defence, critical at a time of global threats to the international order most notably from Putin’s evil war in Ukraine. We also support a group of people to whom we owe our freedom: our brave veterans. I will extend National Insurance relief for employers of eligible veterans for a further year and provide £10m to support the Veterans’ Places, Pathways and People programme. We have shown that we are prepared to increase funding for vital public services, with record numbers of police officers, doctors, nurses and teachers. We are nearly doubling the numbers of doctors and nurses we train, having given the NHS its first ever long-term workforce plan, as I promised to do a year ago. We are also tackling the greatest single preventable cause of mortality the NHS has to deal with by bringing forward plans for a smokefree generation. But alongside extra funding and support, we need to see reform. We need a more productive state not a bigger one.That is why I want the public sector to increase productivity growth by at least half a percent a year, the level at which the size of our state starts to reduce as a proportion of GDP. I have already announced plans to cap and reduce the size of the Civil Service to pre-pandemic levels. Today I pay tribute to the excellent former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt Hon Member for Salisbury, who started our Public Sector Productivity Programme.  It will now be pursued by his formidable successor, the Rt Hon Member for Sevenoaks who has already been with me to meet police, fire and ambulance personnel to understand where bureaucracy is holding them back. Through this vital work we will ensure that over time the growth in public spending is lower than the growth in the economy whilst always protecting the services the public value. I will also provide HMRC with the resources they need to ensure everyone pays the tax they owe, raising an additional £5 billion across the forecast period.GrowthMy Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister also promised to grow the economy. Since 2010, we have presided over faster growth than many of our major competitors including Spain, Italy, France, Germany or Japan. But all of us have faced a pandemic and energy shock. As a result, last autumn the OBR forecast a recession in which the economy was expected to shrink by 1.4% in 2023.  Instead, it grew – in fact it has grown faster than the Euro area. Revised numbers from the ONS now say the economy is 1.8% larger than pre-pandemic.And looking ahead, the OBR expects the economy to grow by 0.6% this year and 0.7% next year. After that, growth rises to 1.4% in 2025, then 1.9% in 2026, 2% in 2027 and 1.7% in 2028. If we want those numbers to be higher, we need higher productivity.  The private sector is more productive in countries like the United States, Germany and France because it invests more – on average 2 percentage points more of GDP every year. The 110 measures I take today help close that gap by boosting business investment by £20 billion a year. They unlock investment with supply side reforms that back British business in the following areas.Growth measuresSkillsFirst, skills. No economy can prosper without investing in the potential of its people.  Despite strong opposition, we took the difficult decisions to reform our schools. England’s 9-10-year-olds are now the 4th best readers in the world and since 2015 our 15–16-year-olds have risen 7 places in the OECD rankings for maths, thanks not least to the efforts of the brilliant Rt Hon Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. But 9 million adults in England still have low basic literacy or numeracy skills. Last month the Prime Minister set out the new Advanced British Standard to ensure all school leavers reach minimum standards in maths and English.So following engagement with Make UK and others, I am announcing funding of £50m over the next two years to pilot ways to increase the number of apprentices in engineering and other key growth sectors.Infrastructure, housing and planningNext, planning. It takes too long to approve infrastructure projects and business planning applications. Many businesses say they would be willing to pay more if they knew their application would be approved faster. So, from next year, working with the Communities Secretary, I will reform the system to allow local authorities to recover the full costs of major business planning applications in return for being required to meet guaranteed faster timelines. If they fail, fees will be refunded automatically with the application being processed free of charge.A prompt service or your money back – just as would be the case in the private sector.Many planning applications are for housebuilding so today we take further decisions to unlock the building of more homes. We will invest £110m over this year and next to deliver high quality nutrient mitigation schemes, unlocking 40,000 homes. We will invest £32m to bust the planning backlog and develop fantastic new housing quarters in Cambridge, London and Leeds which will lead to many thousands of additional dwellings. We will allocate £450m to the Local Authority Housing Fund to deliver 2400 new homes. And we will consult on a new Permitted Development Right to allow any house to be converted into two flats provided the exterior remains unaffected.It is also taking too long for clean energy businesses to access the electricity grid. So, after talking to businesses such as National Grid, Octopus Energy and SSE, we today publish our full response to the Winser review and Connections Action Plan. These measures will cut grid access delays by 90% and offer up to £10,000 off electricity bills over 10 years for those living closest to new transmission infrastructure. Taken together these planning and grid reforms are estimated to accelerate around £90 billion of additional business investment over the next 10 years.FDINext, foreign direct investment. I am extremely grateful to Lord Harrington for his excellent report on how to increase foreign direct investment. We accept all his headline recommendations. In particular, we will put in place a concierge service for large international investors modelled on the best such services offered by our competitors and will increase funding for the Office for Investment to deliver it.Pension fund reformsI now turn to pension fund reforms that will increase the flow of capital going to our most promising growth companies in a way that also improves outcomes for savers. I will take forward my Mansion House reforms starting with measures to consolidate the industry. By 2030, the majority of workplace DC savers will have their pension pots managed in schemes of over £30 billion and by 2040 all local government pension funds will be invested in pools of £200 billion or more.I will support the establishment of investment vehicles for pension funds to use including through the LIFTS competition, a new Growth Fund run by the British Business Bank and opening the PPF as an investment vehicle for smaller DB pension schemes.I will also consult on giving savers a legal right to require a new employer to pay pension contributions into their existing pension pot if they choose, meaning people can move to having one pension pot for life. These reforms could help unlock an extra £75 billion of financing for high growth companies by 2030 and provide an extra £1000 a year in retirement for an average earner saving from 18.Alongside this, I am also progressing further capital market reforms to boost the attractiveness of our markets, and the UK one of the most attractive places to start, grow and list a company. As part of this I will explore options for a Natwest retail share offer in the next 12 months subject to supportive market conditions and achieving value for money. It’s time to get Sid investing again.Innovation industriesNext, I move on to measures to support our most innovative industries. In the last decade we have grown to become……the third largest technology sector in the world, double the size of Germany and three times the size of France…the biggest life sciences industry in Europe…Europe’s third largest generator of renewable electricity after Germany or Norway… and the eighth largest manufacturer in the worldWhen it comes to tech, we know that AI will be at the heart of any future growth. I want to make sure our universities, scientists and start-ups can access the compute power they need.So, building on the success of the supercomputing centres in Edinburgh and Bristol, I will invest a further £500m over the next two years to fund further innovation centres to help make us an AI powerhouse. Our creative industries already support Europe’s largest film and TV sector. This year’s all-Californian blockbuster Barbie was filmed in the constituency of the Hon Member for Watford, where the sun always shines. I know that even more could be invested in visual effects if we increased the generosity of the film and high-end TV tax credits, so I will today launch a call for evidence on how to make that happen. British-discovered vaccines and treatments saved more lives across the world during the pandemic than those from any other country and I’m incredibly proud of our Life Sciences industry. To further support research and development, I am creating a new simplified R&D tax relief, combining the existing R&D Expenditure Credit and SME schemes.I will also reduce the rate at which loss-making companies are taxed within the merged scheme from 25% to 19% and lower the threshold for the additional support for R&D intensive loss-making SMEs that I announced in Spring, to 30%, benefiting a further 5,000 SMEs.  And because 2028 marks the centenary of the invention of penicillin by Alexander Fleming I am giving £5m to Imperial College and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust to set up a Fleming Centre to inspire the next generation of world-changing innovations.For our advanced manufacturing and green energy sectors, international investors say the biggest thing we can do is to announce a longer-term strategy for their industries.So, with the Secretaries of State for Business and Trade and Energy Security and Net Zero, I am today publishing those plans. I confirm that we will make available £4.5 billion of support over the 5 years to 2030 to attract investment into strategic manufacturing sectors.That includes support of £2 billion for zero emission investments in the automotive sector, something that has been warmly welcomed by Nissan and Toyota; £975m for aerospace, building on decades of success from firms like Airbus and Rolls Royce; and £520m for life sciences to build on the strength of world-class British pharma companies like AstraZeneca and GSK.  We will also provide £960m for the new Green Industries Growth Accelerator focused on offshore wind, electricity networks, nuclear, CCUS and hydrogen. These targeted investments will ensure the UK remains competitive in sectors where we are already leaders and innovative in areas where we are not. Taken together across our fastest-growing innovation sectors, this support alone will attract an estimated £2 billion of additional investment every year over the next decade.Levelling upOne of the reasons we support our manufacturing and clean energy sectors is they help to level up growth across the United Kingdom, so I now turn to further levelling up measures.  In the Spring, I announced that we would deliver 12 new Investment Zones – 12 mini-Canary Wharfs – where government, industry and research institutes collaborate across the UK.  Since then, the Exchequer Secretary – the Hon Member for Grantham and Stamford – has done outstanding work across government to bring this vision to fruition. Following tenacious representations by the Hon Member for Ynys Mon and the unstoppable Mayor of Tees Valley, I have today decided to extend the financial incentives for Investment Zones and tax reliefs for Freeports from 5 years to 10 years. I will also set up a new £150m Investment Opportunity Fund to catalyse investment into the programme.On Monday, I confirmed a new Investment Zone in West Yorkshire. Today having listened to representations from the West Midlands salesman-in-Chief, Andy Street, as well as the Hon Member for Mansfield and the Hon Member for Bury North I am also announcing three further Investment Zones focused on advanced manufacturing in the West Midlands, East Midlands and Greater Manchester. Together, local partners expect these will help catalyse over £3.4 billion of private investment and 65,000 new jobs.And having listened to the Hon Member for Wrexham and the Hon Member for Clwyd South, I can announce a second Investment Zone in Wales in the fantastic region of Wrexham and Flintshire, which I will visit tomorrow. We are publishing new devolution deals with four areas including Hull and East Yorkshire and offering devolved powers to even more county areas.On Monday we saw the announcement of £1 billion of funding through Round 3 of the Levelling Up Fund, supporting projects following the campaigning efforts of the Members for Keighley, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Scunthorpe …and of course, Mr Speaker, Chorley.I can also confirm we will proceed with over £50m of funding for high-quality regeneration projects in communities such as Bolsover, Monmouthshire, Warrington, and Eden Valley all of which have particularly effective local MPs as their champions.And I’m announcing £80m for new Levelling Up Partnerships in Scotland, £500,000 to support the Hay Festival in Wales and £3m of additional funding to support the successful Tackling Paramilitarism programme in Northern Ireland.Small businessesNext small business. I ran my own one for 14 years and have always known that every big business was a small business once. The Federation of Small Businesses say that the biggest thing I could do to help their members is end the scourge of late payments. The Procurement Act we have passed means that the 30-day payment terms which are already set for public sector contracts will automatically apply throughout the sub-contract supply chain.But from April 2024 I will also introduce a condition that any company bidding for large government contracts should demonstrate they pay their own invoices within an average of 55 days, which will reduce progressively to 30 days. Any small business will also tell you the biggest frustration is the tax you pay before making a penny of profit – not least business rates. This government has already taken a third of properties out of rates completely through Small Business Rates Relief. We have frozen the tax rate for the last three years at a cost of £14.5 billion. We have removed downwards caps from Transitional Relief.And for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses we have introduced a one year 75% discount on business rates up to £110,000. These measures have saved the average independent shop over £20,000. It is not possible to continue with temporary support measures forever. But whilst the standard multiplier, which applies to high-value properties, will rise in line with inflation, I have today decided that we will freeze the small business multiplier for a further year. And following extensive discussions with the FSB and many colleagues in the House, I have also decided to extend the 75% business rates discount for Retail Hospitality and Leisure businesses for another year. This will save the average independent pub over £12,800 next year and at a cost of £4.3 billion, it is a large tax cut which recognises the role of pubs and high street shops in our communities. I thank the Members for Stockton South, Barrow and Furness and East Devon for their tenacious campaigning on this issue.Finally, I turn to the smallest of all businesses – those run by the self-employed. These are the people who literally kept our country running during the pandemic. The plumbers who fixed our boilers in lockdowns. The delivery drivers who brought us our shopping. The farmers who kept food on our plates. As part of our plans to grow the economy I want to reform and simplify the taxes paid by the self-employed. So today I am announcing a major reform of one of those taxes. It is one most people haven’t heard of, but it is a big deal for those who have to pay it. Class 2 National Insurance is a flat rate compulsory charge, currently £3.45 a week, paid by self-employed people earning more than £12,570 which gives state pension entitlement. Today, after careful consideration and in recognition of the contribution made by self-employed people to our country, I can announce we are abolishing Class 2 National Insurance altogether, saving the average self-employed person £192 a year.Access to entitlements and credits will be maintained in full and those who choose to pay voluntarily will still be able to do so.  But this change simplifies and cuts tax for nearly 2 million self-employed people whilst protecting the interests of those on the lowest pay. Because we value their work, I’m also taking one further step for the self-employed. They also pay Class 4 National Insurance at 9% on all earnings between £12,570 and £50,270. Today, I have decided to cut that tax by 1 percentage point to 8% from April. Taken together with the abolition of the compulsory Class 2 Charge, these reforms will save around 2 million self-employed people an average of £350 a year from April.Mr Speaker, we are backing small business by freezing their business rates, extending retail, hospitality and leisure relief, abolishing compulsory Class 2 National Insurance payments and reducing Class 4 National Insurance by one percentage point in today’s Autumn Statement for growth. Small businesses work so hard for us, so tis government is working hard for them.Full expensingI turn now to my final measure to back British business, Mr Speaker. Since 2010, we have seen the second highest growth in investment of any G7 country.  However, if we are to raise productivity, we need to increase business investment further. In 2021, my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister introduced the super-deduction for large businesses to further stimulate business investment, and this Spring, I introduced “full expensing” for three years.This means that for every million pounds a company invests, they get £250,000 off their tax bill in the very same year.The CBI, Make UK, Energy UK and 200 other business leaders from companies including BT Open Reach, Siemens and Bosch have said making this measure permanent would the “single most transformational” thing I could do for business investment and growth. The Centre for Policy Studies say it would ‘maximise business investment, boost productivity and deliver higher levels of GDP.’ But because it costs £11 billion a year, I made clear that I would only do so when it was affordable. Well, with inflation halved… borrowing down… and debt falling, today I deliver on that promise. I will today make full expensing permanent. That is the largest business tax cut in modern British history. It means we have not just the lowest headline corporation tax rate in the G7 but its most generous capital allowances.The OBR say it will increase annual investment by around £3 billion a year and a total of £14 billion over the forecast period. The way to back British business is to increase the incentives to invest.  We do that today by introducing one of the most generous tax reliefs anywhere in the world, a huge boost to British competitiveness in an Autumn Statement for Growth. Skills, planning and infrastructure reform, pension fund reform, support for innovation industries, levelling up, backing small business and full expensing… Taken together, the overall impact of today’s growth measures will be to increase business investment in the UK economy by around £20 billion a year within a decade, nearly 1% of GDP at today’s level. That is the biggest ever boost for business investment in modern times, a decisive step towards closing the productivity gap with other major economies and the most effective way we can raise wages and living standards for every family in the country.WorkAs well as backing business, you need to back the people without whose effort no businesses can succeed. The entrepreneur taking risks. The builder working weekends. The nurse working nights. And the jobseeker leaving benefits behind. I therefore conclude with three further supply-side reforms designed to improve the incentives to work in a modern, dynamic economy.WelfareI begin with welfare, and I start by thanking the outstanding Work and Pensions Secretary for his help in developing these reforms. He builds on the work of my Rt Hon Friend for Chingford and Woodford Green who introduced Universal Credit. Those reforms helped to reduce unemployment, which has fallen by over one million.  But post-pandemic we still have over seven million adults of working age, excluding students, who are not working despite nearly one million vacancies in the economy. Many can and want to work – but our system makes that too hard.In the Spring Budget I introduced 30 hours of free childcare for working parents of 1- & 2-year-olds. That plan, still opposed by the party opposite, starts rolling out in April. It will help tens of thousands of parents return to work without having to worry about damaging their career prospects.Today we focus on helping those with sickness or disability and the long term unemployed. Every year we sign off over 100,000 people onto benefits with no requirement to look for work because of sickness or disability. That waste of potential is wrong economically and wrong morally. So, with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, last week I announced our Back to Work Plan. We will reform the Fit Note process so that treatment rather than time off work becomes the default. We will reform the Work Capability Assessment to reflect greater flexibility and availability of home working after the pandemic. And we will spend £1.3 billion over the next five years to help nearly 700,000 people with health conditions find jobs. Over 180,000 more people will be helped through the Universal Support Programme and nearly 500,000 more people will be offered treatment for mental health conditions and employment support.Over the forecast period, the OBR judge these measures will more than halve the net flow of people who are signed off work with no work search requirements. At the same time, we will provide a further £1.3 billion of funding to offer extra help to the 300,000 people who have been unemployed for over a year without having sickness or a disability.But we will ask for something in return. If after 18 months of intensive support jobseekers have not found a job, we will roll out a programme requiring them to take part in a mandatory work placement to increase their skills and improve their employability. And if they choose not to engage with the work search process for six months, we will close their case and stop their benefits. Taken together with the labour supply measures I announced in the Spring, the OBR say we will increase the number of people in work by around 200,000 at the end of the forecast period, permanently increasing the size of the economy. We should unlock the potential we have right here at home, which we do with the biggest set of welfare reforms in a decade in today’s Autumn Statement for Growth.Ending low payMr Speaker, if we are to incentivise work, we must also tackle low pay. People who get up early, put in the hours and work hard for their families deserve to be paid fairly. Since 2010, those on the minimum wage – now the National Living Wage – have seen their hourly wage go up from £5.80/hour to £10.42/hour. That’s a real terms increase of more than 20%. Because we’ve also doubled the threshold at which you pay tax or national insurance, their after-tax income has gone up not by 20% but by 25% – more than any other income group.Today, I confirm we will go further and accept the Low Pay Commission recommendation to increase the National Living Wage by 9.8% to £11.44 an hour.That is the largest ever cash increase in the National Living Wage, worth up to £1800 for a full-time worker. Since the National Living Wage has been introduced, the proportion of people on low pay, defined as earning less than two thirds of national median hourly income, has halved. But at the new rate of £11.44 an hour it delivers our manifesto commitment to eliminate low pay altogether. That means by next year someone working full time on the National Living Wage will see their real take-home after-tax pay go up not by 25% but by 30% compared to 2010. The best way to tackle poverty is through work. By reforming the welfare system, reducing workless households and tackling low pay we have helped lift 1.7 million people out of absolute poverty since 2010 because a central part of our plan for growth is to make work pay.TaxAnd so I move to the final supply side measure in today’s Autumn Statement for Growth. Because of the difficult decisions we have taken in the last year, today’s OBR forecast shows that……borrowing will be lower than forecast in the Spring …… debt as a proportion of GDP will be lower than forecast in the Spring…… inflation will continue to fall……and our fiscal headroom has doubled.I said we would cut taxes when we could – but only responsibly and only in a way that did not fuel inflation. The OBR today confirm I can deliver a package which does just that. For businesses, I have today delivered the biggest business tax cut in modern British history with the most competitive investment allowances of any large economy.For the self-employed, I have simplified and reformed their taxes by abolishing the compulsory Class 2 charge and cutting Class 4 National Insurance. But high employment taxes on 27 million people working in the public and private sectors also disincentivise the hard work we should be encouraging. On top of income tax at 20%, they pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 – that’s a 32% marginal tax rate. If we want people to get up early in the morning, if we want people to work nights, if we want an economy where people go the extra mile and work hard then we need to recognise that their hard work benefits all of us. So today, Mr Speaker, I am going to cut the main 12% rate of employee National Insurance.If I cut it by 1 percentage point to 11%, that would be an extra £225 in the pockets of the average worker every year. But instead, I’m going to go further and cut the main rate of Employee National insurance by 2 percentage points from 12% to 10%. This change will help 27 million people. It means someone on the average salary of £35,000 will save over £450. For the average nurse, it is a saving of over £520 and for the typical police officer it is a saving of over £630 every single year. Mr Speaker, I would normally bring in a measure like this for the start of the new tax year in April, but instead tomorrow I’m introducing urgent legislation to bring it in from January 6th, so that people can see the benefit in their payslips at the start of the new year.The OBR say reducing a tax on work means more people in work – and today’s measures ON JUDT National Insurance will lead to the equivalent of 94,000 more full-time employees in our economy. Because lower tax means higher growth.We cut taxes to help bigger businesses invest. We cut taxes to help smaller businesses grow. We cut taxes for the self-employed who keep our country running.And from January, we cut taxes for 27 million working people whose hard work drives our economy forward.ConclusionMr Speaker, the best universities, the cleverest scientists and the smartest entrepreneurs have given us Europe’s most innovative economy.

Rishi Sunak,2023 Speech at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-speech-at-the-lord-mayors-banquet/,"The speech made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, at the Guildhall in London on 13 November 2023.My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,These are deeply challenging times for our world.Events far beyond our shores echo here at home with implications for our security, our economy, and our very social fabric.It falls to us to do everything we can to shape these events.And so, we’ve delivered one of the most significant years for British foreign policy in recent times.That’s due in no small part to James Cleverly.I know he’ll bring the same vigour to the equally vital job of Home Secretary.And I’m pleased to have appointed a new Foreign Secretary who will build on everything we’ve achieved in the last year…A year in which we’ve gone further than ever to support Ukraine as the first G7 nation to move on sending tanks first to send long-range weapons and first to step up on training pilots.In the last few weeks, I’ve travelled to Cyprus, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Cairo, to respond to the crisis in the Middle East and I’m in constant contact with leaders across the region.Since we last gathered here a year ago, we’ve secured the Windsor Framework with the EU launched AUKUS with the US and Australia, building one of the most advanced submarines the world has ever known……signed the Hiroshima Accord with Japan, and the Atlantic Declaration with the US……secured membership of the CPTPP, which will drive global growth……delivered returns agreements to tackle illegal migration – an approach now being followed by many others……and brokered the first international statement on the risks of Artificial Intelligence – including the US and China, something many thought impossible.But these treaties and alliances speak to something deeper:Our willingness to act…to shape the world, not be shaped by it……wherever there’s a challenge, wherever there’s a threat, wherever we can promote peace and security.That’s why we’ve deployed troops to Kosovo, supporting stability in the Balkans.20,000 servicemen and women are on their way to protect NATO’s eastern flank and the high north.Royal Navy vessels are in the Middle East to deter further escalation.And vital humanitarian aid is reaching civilians in Gaza, and across the Horn of Africa – funded by the British people.This is who we are.The difference we make, every single day, across the world, should make each and every one of us here tonight enormously proud.We’re hard-headed about our interests and our security.But Britain’s realism has always had values, and this is a moment for moral clarity.My Lord Mayor,The past is trying to stop the future being born.What motivated Hamas to launch their horrific attack on Israel?It wasn’t just hatred – it was also their fear that a new Middle East was being born……one that would see Israel normalising relations with its neighbours, and which gave hope for a better, more secure, more prosperous way forward.Why did Russia invade Ukraine?Because Putin feared the emergence of a modern, reforming, thriving democracy on his doorstep – and wanted to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past.So, we must keep alive the promise of a better future, bolster those striving for it and stand up for the innocents who Russia see as targets and Hamas see as human shields.I recall those lines from Yeats:“The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere, the ceremony of innocence is drowned… the best lack all conviction, while the worst, are full of passionate intensity.”That’s what our adversaries believe.So, we will outmatch them with our conviction and intensity.We must and we will prove them wrong.Let me set out what that means – in Ukraine, in how we help the most vulnerable around the world and in the Middle East – a region whose tragedy and heartbreak hang heavy on us all.In Israel, I met the families of British victims.I sat with them, held their hands, and saw the profound pain in their eyes.I heard the existential fear that Israelis are feeling.Their country was founded to ensure that what happened in the Holocaust could never happen again.Hamas poses a fundamental challenge to that idea.Hamas have stated clearly: “We will repeat the October 7 attack time and time again until Israel is annihilated.”Last week was the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht.And as we see hatred rising, we all have a responsibility to meet the promise of the words that in recent days have lit up the Brandenburg Gate:“Never again is now.”So, Israel must be able to defend itself against terror, restore its security and bring the hostages home.But there are things that Israel must do as part of its response.We’ve been clear they must act within international law.They must take all possible measures to protect innocent civilians, including at hospitals, stop extremist violence in the West Bank and allow more aid into Gaza.Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, described to me the terrible suffering of the Palestinian people.Too many civilians are losing their lives.That’s why I’ve doubled our aid to Gaza and why we continue to press – both at the UN and directly with Israel – for unhindered humanitarian access and urgent and substantive humanitarian pauses.We want aid coming in by land, air and sea – and we’re ready to use our bases in Cyprus as a staging post.Alleviating the suffering is our foremost priority.But we need to do more – to create a new political horizon.We must unite around the only answer that can come close to creating peace in those troubled lands.The only answer that can acknowledge the history and hurt of both peoples.The only answer that can allow a new future to be born and that is a two-state solution.The UK wrote the original UN resolutions setting this out.We’ve argued the case for decades.But now we must help make it a reality.So, to the UK’s friends across the region, like Jordan, Egypt, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, who support normalisation and peaceful co-existence and to our communities at home……I pledge to redouble efforts to this end.That means providing the serious, practical and enduring support needed to bolster the Palestinian Authority because they are the best route to sweep away the terrible scourge of Hamas and all it has wrought.As hard as it may be, no matter the obstacles, we must put the region on the path to a genuine peace.We’re also supporting a better future for Ukraine.And let me tell you this: the last year has shown that Russia cannot win.They tried to blockade Ukrainian shipping routes – and they failed.Ukraine has pushed back the Black Sea Fleet and made Crimea a vulnerability for Putin rather than a strength.Russia is mounting its third wave of attacks on Avdiivka – and again they continue to fail, at horrendous cost.Since their invasion, Russia has suffered over a quarter of a million casualties…Half of the territory they seized has been taken back…And Putin has faced a more united response than he ever imagined.He’s ensured defence spending is rising across Europe, led by the UK…He’s fast-tracked Finland into NATO, with Sweden close behind…And he’s seen an armed rebellion marching on Moscow.It’s a self-inflicted strategic calamity.Putin’s vain hope is that we lose patience but, friends, we never will.Instead, we’re providing more air defence to protect Ukraine’s cities and infrastructure, more help for the long, hard winter and we’re going further.In February at the Munich Security Conference, I argued Ukraine needs long-term security assurances.And in July, allies delivered.Following the NATO summit, over 30 other leaders joined us in agreeing to put assurances in place.Together we’ll strengthen Ukraine’s defence and boost their economy so they can thrive even while they fight to regain their territory.And, to do so, Ukraine needs the City of London.It needs all of you, it needs expertise and capital – and war risk insurance to support trade and investment and keep the ships moving.I know you’ll deliver.And so will the government – building Ukraine’s navy, training their pilots, and training their soldiers.We’ve now trained over 50,000 Ukrainian troops.President Zelenskyy and I went to meet some of them earlier this year.I recall sitting together on a Chinook flying to the south coast.Over the din of the rotors, we chatted and shared family photos.It was a moment of normality in an abnormal setting – and a reminder of what unites us.In the face of aggression, we will always protect our values and all we hold dear.We will stand with Ukraine until they prevail.Finally, to deliver a better future, we must lead not just with strength, but with compassion, helping the poorest and tackling global problems.So, while Russia seeks to starve the world by choking off food supplies – we’re helping Ukraine get their food to those who need it most.And next week we’re hosting an international conference on alleviating global hunger.While some load the poorest nations with unsustainable debt, the UK is driving fundamental reforms of development finance, including a capital increase for the World Bank.While some talk down our record on climate, we’re actually a world leader, cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country……and with $2 billion recently announced for the Green Climate Fund, I’ve delivered the biggest single international climate pledge the UK has ever made.We’re also a leading donor to global health initiatives, helping vaccinate over a billion children, saving millions of lives.But we bring more to the table than funding – we also bring our expertise.Right now, the world’s first ever malaria vaccine is being rolled out across Africa – with the second one following soon.It has dramatically cut early child mortality.And where were both of those vaccines developed?Right here in the UK.We don’t talk about it enough, but every day Britain is out there helping the poorest and most vulnerable, saving and transforming lives.So, I say it again – this is who we are, and it should make us proud.My Lord Mayor,When conflicts overseas create division at home, it’s more important than ever that we preserve the values we hold dear – tolerance, free speech, the rule of law, respect for our history.We’ll protect all communities from violence and intimidation.And prevent people being drawn into radicalisation.In these dangerous times, we’re not just defending a better vision of the future against those who would destroy it, we’re marshalling our expertise, our people, and our alliances to bring that future into being.We’ll continue to stand up for what is right.We’ll stand with our allies and with the most vulnerable, wherever they may be.We’ll show that the best is full of conviction and that our values will prevail.Thank you.",Conservative

Rishi Sunak,2023 Statement on Armistice Day protests,https://www.ukpol.co.uk/rishi-sunak-2023-statement-on-armistice-day-protests/,"The statement made by Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, on 11 November 2023.I condemn the violent, wholly unacceptable scenes we have seen today from the EDL and associated groups and Hamas sympathisers attending the National March for Palestine. The despicable actions of a minority of people undermine those who have chosen to express their views peacefully.Remembrance weekend is a time for us to come together as a nation and remember those who fought and died for our freedoms. What we have seen today does not defend the honour of our Armed Forces, but utterly disrespects them.That is true for EDL thugs attacking police officers and trespassing on the Cenotaph, and it is true for those singing antisemitic chants and brandishing pro-Hamas signs and clothing on today’s protest. The fear and intimidation the Jewish Community have experienced over the weekend is deplorable.All criminality must be met with the full and swift force of the law. That is what I told the Met Police Commissioner on Wednesday, that is what they are accountable for and that is what I expect.I will be meeting the Met Police Commissioner in the coming days.",Conservative
